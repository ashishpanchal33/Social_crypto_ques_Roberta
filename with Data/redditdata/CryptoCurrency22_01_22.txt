I’ve stated it before on this sub and I’ll state it again, the majority of retail investors are in crypto for the fiat value and potential to increase their wealth exponentially in this crypto gold rush. It is NOT for the tech (even though there is a small minority that can see the big picture and realize crypto is the future and isn’t going anywhere). The paper hands selling due to the FED’s increasing the interest rates, hyperinflation, rumors of wars with Russia and Ukraine and China and Taiwan.. it happens and will continue to happen to have bear markets like this but it isn’t going to crush crypto. We will still be here once the dust settles.

As you know it is impossible to signup a two word email especially now (not even as far as 6-7 words without numbers and dots for all i know). I am now considering to sell it at a considerable profit looking at i don't use it personally due to the high volume of messages incoming but I casually keep it clean and log in to record activity for the past 12 years.

So what do you advice me? Make a video/gif and mint it with the email and upload it on opensea for example (domain names are being sold this way so i think that's similiar)?

If anyone’s interested in the full un-summarized version the link is here:  [https://youtu.be/8-54mXUQ8yw](https://youtu.be/8-54mXUQ8yw)  


The internet of things is a fast-growing paradigm expected to reach a market size of 1.8 trillion in the year 2028, with more and more devices now having the capability to be connected and controlled via Wi-Fi. These devices range from the expected, such as lighting systems, to the somewhat more unexpected, such as cat litter trays, belts, and flip flops.  


 With so many devices now able to share their data, it would make sense to allow end users or companies to monetize this data in some way. For example, what if while you’re driving around your car is automatically selling information about the potholes you’ve come across to the local government, or the amount of traffic to google maps, or the external temperature to any weather service providers.  

# Creation

While a lot of other chains were aiming to compete with Ethereum by being DeFi capable, IOTA was developed with this mantra in mind, companies will always pay to acquire data, and that means that currently IOT devices are underutilised because the data they could provide is currently being wasted.

Along with this the IOTA founders also identified key areas of blockchain technology that they thought could be improved, namely by re-inventing the wheel and switching to a DAG, or directed acyclic graph, based implementation instead that they named the Tangle.

Pre-dating any real cryptocurrency adoption, IOTA’s initial marketing was in the form of a thread on bitcointalk, which is where most of the cryptocurrency discussion was happening before reddit rose to dominance as the place to be for all altcoin related content.

The choice to use a DAG instead of a blockchain was due to the already apparent problems that blockchains would have when it came to scalability, and when the end goal was to have hundreds of millions of devices transmitting data using the platform, and blockchains at the time couldn’t even come close to that. 

# The Tangle

The tangle is pretty much exactly what it sounds like, it’s a big tangle of interconnected transactions.

All you need to know is that unlike a blockchain where every block is built on a previous block and there’s only a single chain, a node in a DAG is connected to multiple previous nodes stemming all the way back to the first node.

In the case of the Tangle, when a new node, or in the case of IOTA, a transaction, is added to the network it must be connected to 2 previous transactions. To add a new transaction the submitter needs to perform a confirmation on the 2 transactions it’s going to be connected to. 

Once a transaction has been added it becomes what’s known as a tip, which is just a transaction that hasn’t received any confirmations yet. Logically there will always be a single tip, however there will in reality be hundreds at any one time. 

However, unlike the name Tangle suggests, the directed part of DAG means that the protocol does still move in a direction, with transactions that go unconfirmed forming blockchain like forks, also known as subbranches. This means that the method for selecting which transactions to confirm is extremely important to avoid reconfirming the same transactions over and over and not moving the main branch forward.

One attack vector present on both blockchains and the Tangle is a 51% attack where a participant performs a double spend but instead of building on transactions any transactions that reference the first transaction, they choose to build on top of older transactions. 

Now, the protocol discourages this behaviour by reducing the likelihood that this new tip will actually be confirmed, so instead the attacker needs to be the one to issue as many transactions as possible on top of this malicious transaction to have the rest of the network start confirming the transactions again.

Currently, the way that IOTA has solved this is using a coordinator.

# Coordinator

The coordinator in the Tangle effectively takes a snapshot of the state of the Tangle every 2 minutes.

All transactions approved within this snapshot are now given a confidence level of 100%, or in other words they’re now set in stone and cannot be undone. With the coordinator, even if a malicious party had the capability to confirm more transactions than the rest of the tangle to overtake it, it wouldn’t work, because the transactions they’re attempting to overwrite are now unreversible.

The coordinator is a centralised segment of the IOTA platform, and currently run by the IOTA foundation. This decision was made because while the network is growing the concerns of an attack outweighed the potential downsides of having a centralised aspect.

# IOTA 2.0

It was inevitable however that IOTA would eventually move to a new consensus mechanism so that the Coordinator could be removed. Given that everything built into the protocol was done so with a view to decentralisation it doesn’t make sense to have such a pivotal centralised component.

This is why with IOTA 2.0, which is currently running currently as a DevNet until the IOTA foundation can be sure the implementation is secure, the consensus mechanism has been reworked to allow for decentralised transaction confirmation.

The simplest way to explain this new consensus change is that now instead of confirmation hash power, the protocol and nodes are in charge of consensus. This is important because the original implementation assumed that there would always be an honest majority in terms of hashing power, unfortunately due to the fact that hashing power is only expended when a transaction is submitted it wouldn’t be too hard for a bad actor to pick quiet network periods and perform a 51% attack.

If enough nodes approve of a transaction, it’ll then have tips selected on a branch that’s accepted by the network and then move on to finalisation and confirmation.

This will mean that the coordinator can both be removed without compromising the security of the network. You can see from the visualiser that the new tangle looks very different to the old one using this method.

IOTA 2.0 also brings new functionality such as Smart Contracts it’s the layer 1.

# Shimmer

When IOTA 2.0 comes to the mainnet, shimmer will become sort of like DevNet currently is but with a view that eventually it will be its own network.

To begin with Shimmer will be used for testing modules that will be coming to the IOTA mainnet, however the state of the ledger isn’t going to be reset with each update and instead it will be left to run as its own decentralised network.

The point of this is to confirm that any mainnet changes will be able to handle real world use and not just work within a test environment. Once the network is no longer needed for this purpose however, or once it diverges too far from the mainnet it will instead be used for implementing functionality not required on the mainnet.

# Assembly

Not to be confused with the base layer smart contracts, IOTA also has assembly. Assembly is a network anchored to the iota layer 1 that allows for automatically sharded and cross chain compatible smart contract chains to run, it also acts as the validator layer for the new smart contract functionality on the base chain.

This would mean that smart contracts built on IOTA could communicate with smart contracts built on Ethereum and a variety of other chains while still utilising the feeless capabilities of IOTA.

# Supply

The max token supply of IOTA is 2 quadrillion seven hundred and seven trillion, however this figure is a little misleading due to how purchasing IOTA works.

The unit of IOTA being purchased is actually an MIOTA where an MIOTA stands for 1 million IOTA, meaning the circulating supply of IOTA is commonly quoted as being 2.7 billion. Over 74% of all IOTA have been staked, however this won’t increase the token supply of IOTA but instead how SMB and ASMB will be distributed, meaning the actual circulating supply of IOTA is 720 million.

# Concerns

My main concern is that IOTA seems to be deviating more and more from its original goal, and instead trying to move into a section of the market already dominated by far more established players.

Now, I want to preface this by saying this is my opinion, and I might end up eating my words if they launch IOTA 2.0, shimmer and assembly and it gets the mass adoption they’re expecting, but in my opinion, this is the wrong move.

Firstly, let me say I think the protocol improvements to go decentralised and the introduction of smart contracts make complete sense.

But the introduction of Assembly and Shimmer to me seem like they want to try and distance themselves from the IoT market, which can only be because they either don’t think it’s a large enough market to sustain IOTA, or they just want to position themselves more in the DeFi space because they think it’s a better opportunity.

As much as I understand why they might have done this, I don’t think we need yet another competitor in the DeFi smart contract space, and the fact they’re doing it by splitting IOTA’s functionality into 3 different tokens just makes an already confusing network more confusing.

To encourage developers to move to a new chain there needs to be a big enough value proposition. Take Cardano as an example here, smart contracts were meant to be all the rage, and the retail investor attention should have led to rapid adoption, but in the last 30 days there’s only been 70 new smart contracts, compare this to Ethereum which has had 500 new contracts in less than 48 hours.

If IOTA wants to compete in this space with the likes of Cosmos or ANKR for cross chain compatibility, or Ethereum for smart contracts they’re going to need to really sell it to developers to give them a reason to move. Compare this to the original IoT goal that saw them collecting partnerships left and right and you might be able to see my concern."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4372877|public|new|self|||IOTA - A Deep Dive|0|[]|0.8|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s9iln6/iota_a_deep_dive/||all_ads|6|1642773148.0|5ee4da62-a8bb-11e7-a919-0eb0b1130990|||||2022-01-21 19:22:28+00:00|t3_s9iln6|0|29||

When do you pull out, where to put stop losses, how much are you willing to let ride out no matter the price.

But that's a moot point now. 

If you don't have a game plan, at this point this crash has likely done the majority of its loss....at least for Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

Unless you believe Bitcoin and crypto is done for, and will never be a tech with much use, or appeal to investors anymore, then the majority of your worries are also done. 

Looking at the past and how far Bitcoin can drop in bear winters, peaking at around -70 to -80% drop from ATH, if Bitcoin were to drop that low again, it would drop somewhere between $13k-20K. 

But that's if you were to time the exact bottom, which may only happen briefly for a month or for a week. 

The more long term prices of a bear winter are more likely gonna be around $20K. This is in a worst case scenario. If you can handle that, then you know what you have to worry about, and you can go to sleep now. 

Best case scenario, within a week or two, the stock market gets over its little tantrum. Realizes the interest rates are only as high as 2020. And the Fed starts talking a little more dovish after seeing what happened this week. 

Crypto bounces back. And it's a repeat of last summer."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4374751|public|new|self|||If you don't have a game plan, turn off your app, and don't look at the charts.

At this point I’m still studying the topic (my investments are still insignificant).

So far, these are some of the vocab I already know:

FUD = Fear, uncertainty and doubt
FOMO = Fear Of Missing Out
HODL = Hold On For Dear Life
MOONING = Price going up high
FIAT = Gonvernment Issued Currency
WHALE = Someone with a lot of crypto
ATH = All Time High, the highest a coin has ever been
BULLISH = Expecting the price will increase
BEARISH = Expecting the price will decrease

What else am I missing?

English is not my main language though.

At least with Coinbase Pro I can buy instantly, but then I have to wait 7 days to transfer it off.   

Crypto.com I have to transfer from my bank, give or take 3-5 days before it shows up to buy. 

Gemini I can buy but have to wait. 

I was thinking I could find a place to use my credit card, but it looks like I have to use an ATM card, and I don't want to pay the high fees associated with that.

As a US Citizen, and Texas resident, I am limited to what exchanges I can onramp with.

Much of the chaos has been caused by fall in BTC. And I think BTC was vulnerable to these crashes because the crypto community has lost their principles.

Here are two things.

1) A lack of decentralization.
2) Following traditional finance and big business to overtake the crypto market.

The first BTC crash happened because of crackdown in China. Our two recent crashes happened because of issues in Kazakhstan and Russia. Whenever these crackdown happen, affected miners sell off their BTC in fear of their local authority. 

All thanks to ASIC mining, BTC became increasingly centralized in these high political risk areas. You need to buy extremely expensive equipment running on high electric bills. The two factors encourages mining in areas of low economic opportunity and authoritarian economies engaged in price control. China, Russia, and Kazakhstan all fit this bill.

It should serve a reminder to you all on the risk of centralizing crypto. Crypto belong to humanity, not to any single political entity. The best way to prevent future crash caused by politics is decentralization. When crypto activity is diversified across the globe, only then can we mitigate superpowers playing games on our investment.

Now it is a good time to rebalance your portfolio. If you want a sound crypto future, please invest in crypto which doesn’t prioritize scale/speed over decentralization. Slow transaction time doesn’t  scare away public adoption like these major crashes do. The public won’t adopt crypto if they see it is just one big casino.

Now it is inevitable that traditional finance and WS will enter crypto. But we need to mitigate their influence. Their objective is not aligned well with crypto. Crypto’s DeFi projects are meant to replace some of the dinosaurs on WS. WS will pursue its own interest and treat crypto as just another risk asset class. They answer to clients who only cares about asset portfolio growth. All this means they will rug pull hard when they think the growth numbers aren’t there. They won’t hold when the crap hits the fan. Thus, you get large volatility.

I encourage you to avoid investing in crypto projects with heavy Wall Street backing. Yes, Wall Street has money everywhere. But you should seek investing in projects with solid growth history before Wall Street moved in. It means the project has a solid community regularly buying up crypto over time. They will be there to lessen the effect of rug pull from WS."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4373219|public|new|self|||Sounds Searching Time|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s9k1jk/sounds_searching_time/||all_ads|6|1642776989.0||||||2022-01-21 20:26:29+00:00|t3_s9k1jk|0|1||

If you’re heavily invested in Crypto and price fluctuations like this are causing you to lose you mind, maybe this will let you reflect on expectations and gain perspective on what speculative investing looks like. Crypto isn’t at a point of adoption where we experience a reliable inverse relationship with the markets at large or news from the Fed. 

I get it. It’s hard watching your balance plummet. It hurts me too, and I’m not making light of the pain. But this is the nature of what we’re invested in. It might be a dip, it might be a bear market. But if you’ve been around a little bit - you know that taking advice or sentiment from Reddit is a fruitless endeavor. And if losing 50% of your total value in a day isn’t an acceptable risk… maybe rethink your overall risk tolerance as it pertains to how your leveraged.

There’s no shame in learning from mistakes and pivoting to a new plan with new information. There’s nothing wrong with hanging on through the waves and sticking to your guns. There’s no wrong answer, because no one knows what will happen next. I won’t say what I did today - because it doesn’t matter - and you shouldn’t care.

This feature was already so futuristic, they used a completely decentralized blockchain model called \*Bluetooth\* which needs absolutely no middle man and in fact also leaves no trace of the transaction.

The problem is that some good investments are on the ethereum network, and if investment is successful and you make some profit you will use that profit to cover for gas fees 💩

Turkey has a lot of things going wrong. According to data from the national statistics office, the country's inflation is around 36 percent.

The two countries could not be further apart in terms of monetary regime either. While Turkey is arguably the epitome of a misguided fiat money system, El Salvador declared the hardest money in human history to be the state currency in 2021.

Yesterday, Thursday, January 20, Bukele paid a visit to Turkey. According to his presidential office, the ostensible purpose of the visit was to discuss bilateral cooperation between the two nations. On the one hand, Bukele opened El Salvador's foreign representation in Ankara. On the other hand, the talks with the Turkish government focused on common trade interests, clean energy sources and stronger military cooperation.

With President Bukele standing second to none for government acceptance of a Bitcoin standard, the question quickly surfaced on social networks like Twitter as to whether Bukele was suggesting Erdogan adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. In view of the galloping inflation, this is an entirely conceivable scenario.

The fact that El Salvador has so readily jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon is primarily for two reasons: The country has a strong to authoritarian president who could de facto impose the decision single-handedly. Secondly, the currency regime is a special one. El Salvador has not had its own currency since 2001, instead relying on the U.S. dollar as its No. 1 means of payment. 

The Turkish leadership has repeatedly glorified the lira in patriotic terms. 

Symbolic political banter, such as price controls in supermarkets, is now also on the agenda. The blame for the currency's decline lies not only with the country's adherence to the key interest rate, which Erdogan is adamantly opposed to raising, but also with foreign financial powers and ""unfair price increases"" by retailers. 

The fact that there was no mention of Bitcoin at the joint press conference of the two heads of state suggests that Erdogan is not interested in establishing Bitcoin as the national currency (for the reasons mentioned). No wonder: most recently, Erdogan had still declared war on cryptocurrencies. There may have been talks about Bitcoin. However, Bukele apparently could not convince Erdogan.

Trezor is inactive for 11 days until plugged into Computer B where my friend realized that the Trezor wasn't loading up the same wallet that was on Computer A, but is still logged into and connected to OS/MM on Computer A. When plugged back into the laptop, they can no longer sign anything for it and MM just freezes because it's not connecting to that wallet anymore.

The lost wallet still shows on MM as ""Trezor 1"" and still connected to OpenSea/MM, can do actions on it but can't sign for the actions.

My friend only has 1 Trezor- The 24 seed works, we've triple checked, did minimal manual brute forcing around some words that coulda have been misspelled, we've been on half a dozen fresh browsers, tried new Trezor/Ledger, used findeth, that address cannot be found anywhere connected to that seed. The Trezor has never been wiped/reset.

When we go to ""account details"" with the QR code, there isn't an option to ""export private key"", only option to ""view on etherscan""

My friend is 99% sure a passphrase wasn't assigned, but does recall seeing locked/hidden accounts maybe accessible via passphrase.

Computer A) Logged into the lost wallet still, connected on OS/MM and tagged ""Trezor 1"", needs Trezor auth to sign/do actions but can't auth because it's not linked to the Trezor anymore. On Trezor, the seed connects to a whole different account without passphrase and no passphrase was used originally.

Computer B) When using the seed to login w/ Trezor, the seed connects to a whole different account without passphrase and no passphrase was used originally.

Past 3 days, we hired Bitcoin Dave (bruteforcer account recovery service) to check around combinations and the key that we have in hand, and so far no word. I'm starting to think the Trezor somehow reset and wiped the account, but the seed phrase should still work?

Disclaimer: *Ya ne Russki, nu ya mogu govorite i chitat Russki yazik* (I'm not Russian, but I can speak and read the Russian language). 

As usual the mass media have painted a dystopian picture of how the authoritarian Russian Federation have decided to ban crypto currencies full stop. Blah, blah.... it's China all over again, blah, blah.

Except that isn't what the report is proposing - and yes, it's only a proposal at this stage - an awfully long way from ever becoming law for multiple reasons. In Russia, government is not actually dictated by the Kremlin, contrary to popular Western perception. Here is what is actually being proposed:

1. A ban of the mining of cryptocurrencies on the territory of the Russian Federation. 
2. A ban on Russian banks permitting their customers to buy, sell or trade cryptocurrencies.
3. A ban on crypto currency exchanges operating on the territory of the Russian Federation. 

Most interestingly of all, the new proposals did not come from the Russian Central Bank (which did ban the use of cryptocurrency as a means of payment in 2020). These new proposals actually came from the FSB (The Federal Security Service), which has proposed:

'A complete ban of all cryptocurrency transactions in Russia, in order to undermine the financing of “foreign agent” media outlets, “undesirable” organizations, and the opposition.'

Given the security situation in Western Russia (border with Ukraine), it's no great surprise that the FSB are currently influencing Russian government policy more so than typically. Yet it remains HIGHLY unlikely that these proposals will ever pass into law. Moreover we've been here before:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cenbank-bitcoin/russia-turns-cold-on-crypto-currencies-idUSKBN1CF0RF


Many commentators agree:

John Wu, president of Ava Labs:

“Once again we’re seeing the crypto markets’ resilience to this kind of posturing. This is just the latest installment in a pattern of monetary authorities calling for a ban of crypto, and either seeing no further action or reversing their stance in the near future.”

Indeed, the Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov recently stated that: “There is no sense in banning them, there is a need to regulate them"".

Then just yesterday, Elizaveta Danilova, the head of the Russian Central Bank's Financial Stability Department, publicly stated that ""Restrictions on owning cryptocurrencies are not envisaged"". 


So what we are seeing is typical of how government operates in Russia: the usual power struggle between the security services and central government.

Some companies will have a reflection tax. This means each transaction a set % is distributed between the current shareholders. 

Example: Someone buys $100 of a token that has a reflection rate of 2%. The current holders would all get a piece of the 2% that was collected in the tax.

Depending on the volume, reflection tax and number of holdersc you can increase your token amount with reflexive tokens.

On a token that regularly trees $300,000 daily, people will gain $1 a day from reflections. 

Liquidity Pool Tax: Some tokens tax go to the liquidity pool. This provides a higher price floor and less volatility.

In many instances tokens that have a liquidity pool provide a higher return than coins that have reflection tax. 

Marketing Tax: This tax goes to the dev team and is used for marketing and development purposes. To grow the token and hopefully your investment.

Buyback: Some tokens use a buyback feature where a percentage of the tax is used to automatically purchase tokens. Each purchase raises the price, increasing your portfolio value.

Burn: The USA is going through extreme inflation because so much money is being printed. It devalues the existing currency. Deflationary crypto projects deflate and raise the value by burning tokens. Burning removes tokens from the circulating supply.

While it might be annoying learning that you’re losing money initially when you invest in a token, in the long term projects with Tokenomics can bring with it many rewards that you will benefit from."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4373671|public||self|||What actually happens to your money when you invest in a token?|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s9m8d8/what_actually_happens_to_your_money_when_you/||all_ads|6|1642782755.0||||||2022-01-21 22:02:35+00:00|t3_s9m8d8|0|1||
