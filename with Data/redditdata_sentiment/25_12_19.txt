Despite the gloomy background, I believe 2020 will be one of the best years in the history of crypto assets bringing record highs. 

Here are the reasons why…

**The broader economy**

We live in extraordinary times. Central banks are determined to avoid a recession at all costs by providing liquidity and cutting rates which creates a speculative investment environment. The low interest rate are pumping the valuations of almost any asset class and are also making money managers climb up the risk ladder in search of a meaningful return. Since government bonds don’t yield anything, investors need to buy corporate debt, the ones who previously bought corporate bonds are now into stocks, the stocks loving investors have moved capital to private equity and venture capital etc.

The FED balance sheet jumped $370 billion since September in a new program which is “not QE”. They also cut the rates 3 times this year fighting against a falling stock market and a “potential global slowdown” due to the trade wars and Brexit. As a result we have fresh all time highs in all major US stock indices. 

Germany is hovering around a recession, avoiding it technically with a dismal 0.1% growth in the 3rd quarter of 2019. At the same time the DAX index was only 1.3% short of making a new all time high this month. 

Even Greece that was on the verge of dropping out of the eurozone four years ago, managed to issue government debt at a negative rate this year.

The cost for avoiding a recession creates a distortion in the valuation of all assets. How do you value anything when interest rates are negative? For great insights on the topic read Howard Marks’ memo on the [“mysterious” negative interest rates.](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/mysterious.pdf)

This search for return will drive more people towards riskier asset classes like growth stocks, venture capital and eventually the luring asymmetric bet of crypto assets. ""Risk on"" state of mind is what crypto needs as the whole asset class (even bitcoin) is perceived as very risky.

**US election year**

Trump will do anything to keep the stock market and the economy going in 2020. The argument is short but compelling. 

He has been very [vocal](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1190269494788263936?s=20) about the new highs and didn’t miss the chance to praise himself for the huge 2019 stock returns. He will likely not do anything that will blow the positive investor sentiment. 

This is another tail wind for risk prone investor behaviour in 2020 which will favour crypto assets.

**The halving narrative**

Bitcoin’s block reward halving is scheduled to occur in mid May 2020. It will bring the daily production from 1800 down to 900 coins per day. This will also cut its annual inflation in half to less than 1.8%. While being twice less powerful than the previous having in 2016, this production cut is still going to influence the price. As a self fulfilling prophecy or a supply-demand result, both previous halvings were followed by an upward price spiral that resulted in a bubble and a blow off top. This is relationship is difficult to ignore and if there is a favourable ""risk on” environment in 2020 there is a good chance it will happen again. It may also come faster as investors will try to front run it. 

Also, this time we have halving events in the two major forks of bitcoin which did not exist back in 2016 - BCH and BSV. Despite being controversial, they are still among the top 10 largest crypto asset. Their supply cut and potential price rise may help feed the whole “bitcoin halving” narrative and create an upward price spiral for the whole sector.

The latest example of a halving was in litecoin this year and it had a very distinct price effect. 

**It’s been a while since the last bubble**

It’s been exactly 2 years after the top of the previous bubble. Most alts are over 90% down from their all time highs. That is a lot of damage  for the speculative investor who came in 2017 and 2018. 

Also the lows in most coins were set one year ago and have not been broken down despite prevalent pessimism. This has been a painful environment for anybody looking for a quick buck. 

There is also a widespread apathy and pessimism among the crypto community with even hardcore believers changing their forecasts to [mediocre](https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem/status/1209457337393647617?s=20) 2020. 

After 2 years and lots of assets down more than 90% from ATH it seems that most of the coins are held by very strong hands. Therefore downward pressure is limited and if it occurs it would be mainly driven by short term speculators.

**Tech development**

The hot word of 2016 was “blockchain”. The whole world got excited about it in 2017. 2019 is the year of DeFi. 

In case bitcoin gets close to $20 000 again the “late"" money will flood once again to smaller crypto assets seeking higher returns. If/when bitcoin’s blocks get full and transactions become expensive the old narrative of “bitcoin doesn’t scale” would become valid again and this would spread money to BCH, BSV, ETH and others.

Another potential narrative that exists today is the “decentralised finance”  - exchanges, derivatives, stablecoins, borrowing, lending all that infrastructure got far more sophisticated since the last bubble. Apart from DeFi projects tokens, Ethereum is also poised to be one of the top beneficiaries of this trend as it hosts most of the DeFI activities. However the ""Ethereum doesn’t scale"" narrative is also valid so a lot of money could spill over to the competition in the smart contract space.

It’s been more than 2 years since the scaling problems became obvious and a lot of projects that specialised in that domain are up and running. Others are at the final stages of being launched. What would be a better test than a real world influx of new users and apps that will try to fill the capacity. The process of finding a proper scaling pathway will be pushed forward in case of another bubble. 

**Conclusion**

That scenario will change in case of a global recession that brings the “risk off” attitude. Then assets will fall into a negative price spiral and investors will be looking to preserve their capital by fleeing to “safer” assets. Although such a recession is inevitable at some point, it seems that central banks have been very good at avoiding it by kicking the can down the road. If they succeed again in 2020, get ready for an explosive crypto year. However, do not assume this run will be the same as 2017. It depends much on the global economy and investors’ risk appetite and it may be cut off earlier and not result in a full blown bubble like the one from 2017. The sensible investor needs to be cautious and plan for the short run in this environment."|False|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|952895|public|self|2020 Will Bring Record Highs for Crypto Assets Despite Pessimism|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/eff9bj/2020_will_bring_record_highs_for_crypto_assets/|all_ads|6|1577251691.0|FINANCE|709d50a8-1deb-11e4-9b08-12313b0b24aa|FINANCE|||||||||||2019-12-25 10:58:11+00:00|t3_eff9bj|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]|[]|||||||||||||||||||||25_12_19|12_19|0.07180818|0.4595531|0.4686387|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.11978783458471298|0.24547013640403748|0.03017503023147583|0.39705783128738403|0.18479794263839722|0.022711189463734627

If not how do I store different cryptocurrency and stake them safely? 

I have yet to make a hot/cold wallet, still learning what they even are. I have seen btc/ether software systems that make your own wallet key on blockchain but what if I'm invested in another cryptocurrency?

500 eth went out yesterday, and straight into bitfinex a few minutes later.

There's still over 46,000 eth that can be withdrawn and liquidated by whoever controls this address, but Richard Heart, who created the contract says nobody needs to know who that is.

The Hex token itself trades for between 1 and 2 satoshis and its issuance price has gone from 47,000 hex per Eth on day one to 900,000 hex per Eth as of the last issuing day.

I can only hope that most of the eth still going in to this venture is from Richard himself to make it seem like there is continued demand for this token, but it's sad to see how many people fell for this despite all the warnings."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|952893|public|self|Following the HEX scam?

Many stores acceept Bitcoin as the only cryptocurrency these days. However, Bitcoin's extreme price volatility is a huge issue. Recent I bought a $1000 product from a merchant. I sent him $1000 worth of Bitcoin but at the time he received it it was worth $960 which caused a lot of issues. Not only Bitcoin price fluctates a lot, there also are big price differences between crypto exchanges. Bitcoin transactions alse take long and transaction fees are high.

Doesn't using Tether or or Stablecoins make much more sense ? I could simply sent him 1000USDT and knew that he will receive $1000.

And I thought I had to share my experience with you guys.

A little info about the ""game"". (The reason why I put it in quotation marks is that it's more of an experiment rather than a game)  
The game is created on the Tron network. And what I find intriguing about this certain dapp, is that it is an A.I trying to keep itself alive. YIKES. And that isn't the only fascinating thing about this project, what I also really enjoy about this, is that it's based on fear and emotions. ""when do I buy?"", ""When do I sell?"", ""Am I going to win?"". And believe it or not, there actually is an answer to all these questions... ""Nobody Knows!""

Yes, getting in early might earn you a lot of money, but getting in late can earn you even more!  
That's what I really like about this, it isn't only about getting in early. There are so many different factors decided by the A.I that makes it unpredictable.

Let me go into depth a bit more.  
The A.I decides what is best for itself to keep the game alive and running, ultimately benefitting everyone involved.  
The game is all based on ""Boxes"", an asset or a share of the A.I. The boxes start with a value of 0, and can only increase in price. Let me explain. When you buy a ""box"" or a share of the A.I, you receive royalties that accumulate within the boxes, and your royalties will never decrease in value.   
When you feel satisfied with what's within your box, you can choose to sell them and receive 2 times of what's inside them. So if you choose to sell your 10 boxes that have accumulated 1,000 trx, you can sell them and receive 2,000 trx. But here's the catch, only if you do it before the **timer** runs out.

That brings me on to the **Timer.** with every box bought and sold 2 minutes is added to the timer, which can only go up to 12 hours. When the timer hits 0, every box gets opened automatically, and you receive what's within them. But if you would've sold your boxes before the timer ran out, you would have received 2 times of what's within them.  
This creates a paradox, of when to open your boxes. Because if you open them before the timer runs out you get double of what's within them, but the game might continue for another year, which means you would miss out on potential gains.

But what incentivizes people to keep the timer going?  
This is where it gets interesting. If you are one of the last 100 people to buy or open a box, you win a grand prize, currently 15,000$. And if you're absolutely last you would currently receive 50,000$. This is what will keep the game alive for many months, possibly years.

I just posted instructions at stackexchange which shows how someone could steal all your DAI (or any other token), even though the MetaMask verification screen shows ""0"" as the amount that will be transferred, and does not show the token name:

[https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/78504/metamask-verification-screen-doesnt-show-amount-or-token-when-i-use-approveand](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/78504/metamask-verification-screen-doesnt-show-amount-or-token-when-i-use-approveand)

Someone could create a website that says ""Don't worry about the MetaMask verification screen that shows no money will be transferred, it just allows us to show you more data."" The instant you click \[Confirm\], **all your DAI** (or any other token) will be immediately and irreversibly transferred to the culprit's contract, ***with no warning***."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|196730|public|self|[EXTREMELY CRITICAL] Huge vulnerability in MetaMask, I should receive a bounty for discovering this|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/efl578/extremely_critical_huge_vulnerability_in_metamask/|house_only|1|1577284854.0|warning|53a5cb7a-adf6-11e3-ac3a-12313d31e5b1|Warning|||||||||||2019-12-25 20:10:54+00:00|t3_efl578|0|0|0.5||0||[]|False|False|[]|[]|||||||||||||||||||||25_12_19|12_19|0.16083077|0.5753022|0.26386702|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.09470011293888092|0.40389102697372437|0.023296259343624115|0.26868003606796265|0.1877441257238388|0.021688412874937057
