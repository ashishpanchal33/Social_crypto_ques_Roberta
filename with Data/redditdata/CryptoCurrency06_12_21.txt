No, almost all of them said we will hit 100k soon for BTC. The reason I'm posting this is that you shouldn't put too much emphasis on social media to make a decision for you.

It’s easier for me to feel comfortable putting real buying power behind something I have used and understand. I’m going to outline how it went for me personally. 

**im not here to hate on your beloved coin or ecosystem just an honest account of my experience**

***Pancake swap***. I started here. To be honest I have to take in account it was my first and had a large learning curve. I first had to set up a wallet, move crypto around and swap tokens to get into a pool and farm. I managed to do it but the fees felt high to me for a small guy. Returns are still there apy is still very high in financial standards. Wasn’t my favorite but it was my launch point. 


***Algo*** this was my second. Let me be clear, I have a large bag in both algo and yieldly now, that being said wow! If you want to learn DeFi please take this tiny bit of advice and start here even if it’s 2$ worth. The ease of the ecosystem, the speed, the looks and feel everything felt seamless. Not messing with custom nets just easy. Set up a algo wallet, swap some coins on tinyman and set them in yieldly. The no loss lottery, the automatic staking in the wallet plus governance. Lots to do and easy to do it. It’s my morning routine now to compound my yieldly stake. Guys love them or hate them Algo is the place to learn how it all works! 

***Mochi*** this was a fun little gamble just to start out the wild apy chasing. Got in with relative ease and learned a good amount doing it. Would I recommend it absolutely not haha. Was it fun and a learning opportunity yes! These kinds of projects taught me to watch the coin closely look for when they started and beware of the start up pump and dumps. Overall decent experience. 

***raydium*** I had some sol sitting and thought I would give some one a go. The raydium / phantom looked sleek enough and prices looked stable(ish) overall I found the phantom system easy to use and I’ve been happy with the system. I would say comparable to algo in some ways but lacking the added bonuses algo has. Recommend giving it a look. 


***viper*** again I had some one and also wanted to get a little Roy. I’ve been ok with the viper system but honestly they can be very confusing. It’s difficult to keep track of things and I am weary of a rug pull vibe. Idk if I would recommend the defi options but they are useful in the swap options. I’m still in but not even sure I’m fully understanding everything going on. It’s a “meh” from me.  

***wagmi*** guys this one is out there. All I can say is 800,000+% apy I threw 20$ in. I’m happy. It was easy. But deff not something I could feasibly “recommend” 

***harmony one*** staking directly. I would say moderately easy. Platform is wildly just ok. I have some connectivity issues here and there. Is it doing what it says sure. Am I stoked not wildly. It’s there and it works. 

***Yoroi*** I would same very similar to above. It’s there, it works, it does what it says. Nothing to really say other than that. Relatively easy.

***VVS*** ok I have a large bag of CRO. My plan was to take some early yield profits on this guy. Relatively easy. Goofy names and graphics takes a lot of hate for early roller coaster but honestly turned out more stable than I expected. Would I recommend nah I think the risk is massive. Easy to use kinda. 

***CDC defi wallet*** if you have extra CRO I would cautiously use it. 13% isn’t bad! Decently easy, it’s ability to link with cdc account makes ease of use up there with algo. They do however have lots of options. It would be wise to learn how to pick good staking services before getting caught in a Defi scam somehow. Don’t love the unbonding time but accepted it. 

***keplr*** short and sweet very similar to how cdc defi wallet is. I don’t love it I don’t hate it. Does what it says. Fees are there not outrageous. Don’t love the look. Decently easy. Don’t love the unbonding times. Accept them. 

TLDR; honest opinion, if your looking to learn how to navigate the DeFi world I highly highly recommend you use algo first. It will set you up with an easy key to success in learning how they work. Know one you can figure out the rest. Do your self a favor, start with the easiest one first. Even if you leave! 

No I’m not elegant, just wanted to share my experiences.

[Sundaeswap](https://sundaeswap.finance/) is the token of probably the most anticipated DEX on Cardano. They released their testnet today.

Now why should you buy a DEX token ?

# The other DEXes

I'll start by checking the [top DEX list on coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/dex) and focus on their tokenomics and token's price

## Uniswap

Uniswap's token: UNI is a governance token, meaning it allows you to vote on the direction the DEX will take.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hytvumjtpx381.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fe340ae1ec9defa08f3b877511067bf5f807025

## Pancakeswap

Uniswap's token: CAKE is a governance token, meaning it allows you to vote on the direction the DEX will take. It is also the token for a lottery, or to buy some NFTs available on the platform

&amp;#x200B;

## Trader Joe

Trader Joe's token: JOE is a governance token, meaning it allows you to vote on the direction the DEX will take.

&amp;#x200B;

## Sushiswap

Sushiswap's token: SUSHI is a governance token, meaning it allows you to vote on the direction the DEX will take.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/asek8qgwpx381.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19d20546c5040420ee0aef097d994b2632b5efdb

## Summary of other DEXes

Alright, I'll stop here, but you can look yourself to others by yourself. I'll sumarize on two points :

* Tokenomics: DEX tokens are just governance tokens, there is nothing more to them except earning them then selling them. (CAKE is a real outsider here) This means there is little point to buy them, thus weak buy pressure
* Price action: What we see is generally four phases:

1. a launch phase with a low price
2. a rally phase when the mass onboard the project to join the liquidity pools
3. a dump phase, once enough people join, early holders take profits and crash the price
4. a consolidation phase, where the price is generally stable. There can be a slow trend upward or downward, but I feel like it's mostly downward except for the big projects

Of course, we see outliers, there is a few projects like CURVE which skip the rally and start straight into dump phase

## Comparing to SUNDAE

The most particular point of SUNDAE is its tokenomics; it's not only a governance token! Holding SUNDAE will give you lower fee while using Sundaeswap. This is not something I saw in any other DEX... but definitely not unheard in exchange.. Because it's a  staple of CEXes.

This brings a huge incentive to buy and hold the tokens. At this point, we have to look into CEXes token's price action... Actually I don't need to, I'm sure you're quite aware of the price movement of BNB, CRO, KCS, FTT... Big bullish

# Conclusion

SUNDAE's token seems to inherit from both DEX and CEX, which mean I guess it means we can expect it have a real tendency to have its price keeping making highs. Big bullish ! Except if we look into DEXes' tokens, I expect a huge dump either near the launch, or maybe even right at it.

So what is my financial advice? Well, I don't fucking know! But at least, whether it goes up, or crash, I'll be prepared to say ""I said so"" with a smug face."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4072397|public|https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/drexS7JxwURRJ8vQ5CmVnYA5JIIot3GOkgOvtCxEEC8.jpg|Why I am bullish on SUNDAE, but not too much|1|[]|0.65|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ra8uv0/why_i_am_bullish_on_sundae_but_not_too_much/|all_ads|6|1638782110.0|c1034ee6-9c2a-11e3-a8c4-12313b0e8e20||{'480ldggupx381': {'e': 'Image', 'id': '480ldggupx381', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/480ldggupx381.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2e841d5bf2e73c591062a493079cb20e52cb0e4', 'x': 108, 'y': 61}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/480ldggupx381.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee97691eaab30433bda257d30ead55201ee1e6aa', 'x': 216, 'y': 122}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/480ldggupx381.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c06cb7f76783d6995c6d62ca691697ce64fde84', 'x': 320, 'y': 181}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/480ldggupx381.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=631b263dfca9a71033f16161bf60c959122f2141', 'x': 640, 'y': 363}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/480ldggupx381.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22bcf4762ec57ec9167b9a799268d5a8870ea6d8', 'x': 822, 'y': 467}, 'status': 'valid'}, 'asek8qgwpx381': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'asek8qgwpx381', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/asek8qgwpx381.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c588ff0479c8879aa692c7b0deecc604d732346', 'x': 108, 'y': 61}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/asek8qgwpx381.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16132aed5afd10da553fa41bd6998cf688c0d67e', 'x': 216, 'y': 122}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/asek8qgwpx381.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fef83fd8396afa94d60ccb83f398794a4e3203d5', 'x': 320, 'y': 182}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/asek8qgwpx381.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79ea78084e2390ea75d09850661f51bdd5a0fd2e', 'x': 640, 'y': 364}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/asek8qgwpx381.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19d20546c5040420ee0aef097d994b2632b5efdb', 'x': 822, 'y': 468}, 'status': 'valid'}, 'hytvumjtpx381': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'hytvumjtpx381', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/hytvumjtpx381.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=014173d03c8c83de4d29c38c3ed20dbf37c8a39f', 'x': 108, 'y': 61}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/hytvumjtpx381.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f06346d84ffbb3c40fac677ee57c80a9d70eabae', 'x': 216, 'y': 122}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/hytvumjtpx381.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81d0169b177abaa5802743fdc1dfb625ceca3c5c', 'x': 320, 'y': 181}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/hytvumjtpx381.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71d3424ac9b9bd8b84fff0e0d98346a13d192a9c', 'x': 640, 'y': 362}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/hytvumjtpx381.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fe340ae1ec9defa08f3b877511067bf5f807025', 'x': 822, 'y': 466}, 'status': 'valid'}, 'pmbb18svpx381': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'pmbb18svpx381', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/pmbb18svpx381.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bff46387556a9116f52c95368ed100b2c66752e', 'x': 108, 'y': 61}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/pmbb18svpx381.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfaa2da9e6b1eaa731eb276c3ee38e01eee7975e', 'x': 216, 'y': 123}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/pmbb18svpx381.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8de6817f39fc3a8ece925489796969687c82e015', 'x': 320, 'y': 182}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/pmbb18svpx381.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c21d91fdee8aa1bf2f7a349453d7e142a7421e', 'x': 640, 'y': 365}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/pmbb18svpx381.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66f8f9b9cc1a7732d3435ffd276592fdd826850', 'x': 821, 'y': 469}, 'status': 'valid'}}|79.0|140.0|||||||||||2021-12-06 14:45:10+00:00|t3_ra8uv0|0|10||

Just don’t be salty and let people invest in what they like especially if its a coin with utility. I’m heavyyy on governance tokens like ALGO and AAVE and I keep aside some funds for new DeFi projects like New Order once it launches on SushiSwap this Thursday.

If not wouldn't it be possible to lock your assets on a smart contract with a time-lock (or some kind of liquidity), and 100% of the staking rewards go to charity. (Okay maybe not 100% zero loss but you don't lose the initial transaction). I feel like it would be an interesting way of giving to charity if its on a smart contract and open source to remove the trust in the system.

I have mine listed on opensea but I'm sure there are other places to buy and sell them as well.

The CME futures opens at 6:00 EST. By the time they open I feel like those 2 prices have to come together.  Futures down or cash up. 

If the brokers try to liquidate the futures contracts to meet margin requirements the futures tank by $5,000 and continues as selling is forced.  If the cash players think that won't happen,  they could bid the futures up to the cash price.

I'd like to see us move away from Tether, as someone who's invested in cryptocurrency, USDT is the one thing I'm absolutely suspicious of. Whether it is the proof of asset backing or the simple fact that a company of a little more than a dozen of employees managing $75B of value seems so outlandish.

My ideal way of achieving that would be to slowly start using to trade/send other stablecoins instead, stablecoins like: USDC, BUSD, UST or DAI. They all seem more trustworthy to me.

I never click on any shady links or anything like that, not even active too much in crypto. I have a Metamask plugin protected with a strong password (Chrome on PC with windows 10, i don't use it on mobile at all), there are five (5) different accounts stored within it. I have every addresses belonging private key stored safely on a cloud protected with 2fa. I have never approved any shady smart contract (checked it with [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) now).

I logged in my Metamask after a week or so and noticed one account of five is empty - checked etherscan and immediately noticed that i didn't initiate the transfer since i didn't recognize the receiving address. Can't explain how bad it felt/feels.

Hackers address: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x146e2176def45ef0807f03d639556eda825107af](https://etherscan.io/address/0x146e2176def45ef0807f03d639556eda825107af)  
**0x146e2176DEf45Ef0807F03d639556EdA825107aF**

Spent the whole day trying to figure out where i made a mistake and just can't find it.  
\- Checked browser history for any phishing links - nothing.  
\- Checked downloads - nothing, i rarely download anything.  
\- Nobody could've triggered it directly from my computer since it happend during the night and only my gf was in the house on that day - not an inside job.

Since i obviously could've missed something, it could be that I somehow infected my computer with a keylogger or anything similar ages ago (up to a year, my windows 10 were installed a year ago) and it eventually detected private key copy-paste into my metamask. But again, i still have zero idea of when that could happen.

Is there any way i can report the address to etherscan/exchanges (i don't have proof that it's phishing). I ran Virus &amp; threat protection (within windows) and it found one potential threat, i immediately removed it. Installed Avast and it didn't find anything afterwards anymore. Now i can't find anymore what that thing that windows found was. Any hints regarding that matter would be highly appreciated. I'd really like to know how this happened.

TL;DR  
Even though i'm not new in crypto I found one of my ETH wallets drained. Thought it can't happen to me and i feel crushed now.

I want to start using a good and reliable snipe bot for bsc. I read an article where a bot was published that can do all these things  
 Snipes in mempool.  
Buy, approve, sell in the same block as liquidity.  
DxSale sniper.  
Snipes antibot tokens.  
Timer before buying.  
Honeypot / Ruggpull checker.  
Auto Approve tokens.  
Simple buy.  
Simple approve.  
Simple sell.  
Easy to use interface  
Easy to use settings file

After sniping the bot can do 3 things:

Sell token after a certain amount of time.  
Sell token when you want it to sell, bot will display the current token price and % profit every 0.1 sec.  
HODL!!

Reason why i don't try this bot is because the youtube account linked to the article has been taken down and there's not much activity from members on the twitter account. So not sure if this bot is save to just download.  


This is the article btw if anyone wants to double check for me :)

Wiping out so much fake cash will set the cryptomarkets back at least 5 years and that will set off another 3 year bear market. After that regulation will come in and start regulating the markets.

I am currently living in the US and my father who lives abroad plans to send me crypto as a gift.

We are exploring USDT and USDC.

From my understanding when I sell the gifted crypto I would need to know my father’s cost basis of the gifted asset. That’s how I would calculate my realized gains/losses for tax purposes. Theoretically, when using USDT or USDC the cost basis should remain unchanged since the price of these assets should remain unchanged. Or at least that’s the goal.

My question is - what kind of proof/documentation would the IRS need from me to prove my father’s cost basis? The goal is to not report/incur any capital gains/losses. In all the documents I have come across it’s simply said that I should “know” the gifter’s cost basis.

I am keen to get involved in projects, not just to reap the rewards but also to support projects that I believe in and that provide a real solution. 

I was wondering if there are other ecosystems that I am not aware off that one can participate in as an ordinary person with decent equipment at home. I am talking about 32GB RAM, 2TB storage, AMD Ryzen 9, GeForce GTX 1080. 

What projects might you be aware off that you can recommend? I am thinking of the likes of Storj Storage Node, Theta Guardian/Edge Node, Monero Solo/Pool Mining, ...

I don't mind if it is a well established project or a newcomer with a great idea.

Looking forward to hearing your suggestions!"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4065518|public|self|Participate in projects having idle computing power sitting around|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r9mkop/participate_in_projects_having_idle_computing/|all_ads|6|1638710928.0|02ff01dc-f3e5-11e5-b968-0ecf7e00c6db|||||||||||||||2021-12-05 18:58:48+00:00|t3_r9mkop|0|1||
