My rules included strong DD, long-term potential, past history of performance, buy and hold for a 20% gain (news-dependent, too) or set stop losses at 8%. This way I could have 2 ""losers"" and one winner and still be up 4%. I did poorly, not because my rules sucked, but because I had no discipline. I would get emotionally invested, hold past -8%, try to squeeze out a 22% gain, etc. BIG MONEY would come in and do whatever they wanted with a stock price.  Shake out the weak hands, scoop up my shares at a discount, and I'd be just sitting here licking my wounds.  ""This is fine.""

Now here comes crypto and most traditional stock advice goes out the window. THIS WAS REFRESHING since I couldn't hack it with regular stock trading. BUY and HODL is the mantra, and to me, this is something I know I can do.  So, I've got a little cheat sheet for myself, and this is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor, its just where I am right now with crypto. Maybe you are, too.

**Basic Rules I'm Following:**

1. **Only spend what you're okay with potentially losing.** Of course, I don't want to lose any money, but a few hundred bucks per month...I can live with that with my current income.

2. **Buy real coins with real potential.**  Just like stocks, I want solid potential. ADA, ETH, VET, ALGO, etc. all are either currently working and doing what they were meant to or are well on their way. S*** coins are called that for a reason...and I'm not willing to ""play"" in that arena.

3.  **Stick with coins that have a max supply.**  Inflation-killer. America prints fiat, fiat becomes less valuable. It's just logic. Sure, you can make money with unlimited supply coins. People got rich of one of those recently. I can't hack it and I know it. I know my limits.

4.  **Stay emotionally unattached!**  I look at this as like a fancy savings account.  I never got emotional when my savings account earned 0.0000002% per year. Hence, I no longer have a savings account of any significance (3 months salary, just in case). Crypto is my store of value. 

5. **Hold.**  I've heard many on here say they are holding until it becomes life-changing or it all goes away. I love that attitude. I'm in a long trade here, 8+ years I'm thinking, DCA-ing along the way.

So, don't let these billionaires with their ""statements"" and ""tweets"" impact your decisions. Don't let their attempts at price manipulation shake you.  If you bought this year and you're still hodling, you just survived a HUGE dip/correction/loss/etc. I think it was one of the biggest drops in history for some coins(?).  Where are you now? Up. 75% of my hodlings are back in the green.  We're all back up.  And now YOU are a ""survivor"" and got the battle scars to prove it. 

Stay strong. Stay long."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3020683|public|self|It's Like Anything In Life: They Are Trying To Manipulate You To Get Your Money|5|[]|0.83|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nrk4wr/its_like_anything_in_life_they_are_trying_to/|all_ads|6|1622724584.0|||||||||||||2021-06-03 18:19:44+00:00|t3_nrk4wr|0|75||

Blockchain networks will reduce fees, bring more transparency to the murky world of big finance and dramatically reduce the transfer time for sending money around the world.

In this post, our own Sam Klemens explores what blockchain is, how blockchain in banking will work, and a few of the key advantages that blockchains offer versus the existing financial system.

# How Blockchain Works

A blockchain is a decentralized network that typically has several qualities:

* Anyone can use the network without having to acquire special permission
* Most blockchain networks are transparent
* Good blockchain networks are immutable, which means that data and transactions cannot be altered
* Blockchains are secured via community participation rather than via a centralized server

It can be helpful to compare and contrast a blockchain network with a database. Only certain permissioned users can access the information stored on a database. A database is centralized in one location and secured by a single company or organization. Authorized users can easily alter information that’s stored on a database. 

Blockchains have many different use cases:

* Blockchain banking is popular right now with [DeFi on the Ethereum network](https://www.exodus.io/blog/tag/decentralized-finance-defi). Users can lend, borrow and exchange assets on decentralized platforms that a centralized company doesn’t control
* Blockchains can be used to send value, as is the case with Bitcoin and other monetary blockchains like Litecoin or Nano
* When considering blockchain financial services, most blockchain currencies have a limit on the number of coins that can be created. This makes them suitable as inflation hedges (there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin)
* Anyone can use a blockchain to timestamp data. Blockchains are fantastic for timestamping because they cannot be modified
* Blockchains will eventually make a majority of accounting and back-office jobs redundant, although this could take ten or fifteen years

One downside of blockchains is that they’re not very good at storing data. If a blockchain financial services firm needs to store significant amounts of data, a database is much more suitable. However, some blockchain projects (such as Bluzelle, SIA, and Filecoin) have been built to address this.

Another downside is that many public blockchains have scaling problems. Most blockchain banking networks are not currently fast enough to support the type of traffic that PayPal can process.

**Private blockchains**

A private blockchain is a network that’s controlled by one company or a consortium of companies. [R3](https://www.r3.com/) is one of the most well-known private blockchains, and it’s [been around since](https://www.r3.com/history/) 2014. For blockchain in banking, JP Morgan also has a private blockchain that their [JPM stablecoin](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/news/digital-coin-payments) is built on. Only institutional JP Morgan clients can use the JPM coin.

A private blockchain’s key disadvantage is that it’s a closed-off system that only a select group of people can access. Private blockchain financial services solutions lack the interoperability of a network like Ethereum.

The major advantage of private blockchain banking is that these networks can scale to thousands of transactions per second. Private blockchain networks are usually faster than public blockchain networks because they sacrifice security and inclusivity for speed and efficiency.

If private blockchain financial services are faster, does that mean they’ll be the most adopted solution?

It’s unlikely that this will be the case. Public blockchains have such a large network effect that it makes a lot more sense to build on them, versus a private blockchain. The consulting firm EY has spent several million dollars [building out infrastructure](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjessel/2020/01/06/ernst--young-doubles-down-on-their-bet-with-ethereum/?sh=52649b7348b1) on top of Ethereum because they believe that businesses will use public blockchains in the future.

Furthermore, there’s a lot of work being done to scale public blockchains so that they can handle enough transactions to make them commercially viable.

# How Blockchain Financial Services will Change the World

There are quite a few ways that blockchain in banking is going to change the legacy financial system. Here are a few of the best examples:

**Faster &amp; Cheaper Remittance**

Multinational corporations are going to be one of the largest beneficiaries of blockchain financial services. Corporations can use blockchain based stablecoins to send millions or billions of dollars to anywhere in the world for a negligible fee.

International money transfers with the existing financial system can take days or even a week or more, depending on the location. Blockchain banking will be an exponential improvement over this outdated system.

**Smart Contracts to Take Over the Accounting Department**

Software is eating the world, and blockchain financial services are just the latest example of this phenomenon. Financial smart contracts are going to revolutionize the accounting industry. Here are a few of the services that smart contracts can offer. 

* Automatic payments to a distributor once the merchandise is received
* Automatic tax payments
* A more efficient accounting ledger for a business
* Automatic currency exchange between stablecoins

While it’s not a positive sign for employment, the stark truth is that smart contracts are going to make millions of jobs redundant. Blockchain banking contracts will replace many accountants, back-office staff, and lawyers.

The employment situation is bad news, but the good news is that smart contracts will lower the costs for businesses all over the world. Some percentage of that saving will be passed on to consumers.

**Offering Blockchain Financial Services to Customers**

DeFi, which stands for Decentralized Finance, has become an extremely popular part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. DeFi users can borrow money, deposit money to earn interest or exchange their assets on decentralized exchanges. All of this is groundbreaking technology and the amount of money that’s locked up in DeFi has been [growing exponentially](https://defipulse.com/) since 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k0n40eijy2371.png?width=1798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8771d25a2ac7afeaf7ac53b79ddb3c09f29f9011

The problem is that decentralized applications are not so easy to use. To use DeFi you have to know how to set up a crypto wallet, send money to different addresses, and interface with blockchain apps that are not always intuitive.

The legacy financial system could benefit from DeFi by creating a more user-friendly interface for some of these decentralized applications. A bank could connect to a DeFi protocol on the backend and then allow their customers to access that application right through their banking website.

The bank would benefit by taking a small fee for this service, and customers would benefit because they could access decentralized protocols without needing a deep understanding of blockchain technology.

**Who Will Benefit the Most from Blockchain Banking?**

The cool thing about blockchain technology in banking is that everyone is going to benefit from it. Blockchain is like the internet, it’s a universally beneficial technology.

Large corporations will send money all over the world for only a fraction of what it costs today. People who save money can deposit it with DeFi applications to earn a real interest rate, not the 0% rate that’s common for most bank accounts.

Banks that adopt blockchain will be able to offer sophisticated financial products to their customers. These forward-looking banks can charge for the service and also grow their customer base.

Who will get hurt? Businesses and banks that don’t adopt blockchain. They will become uncompetitive compared to their rivals who keep up with the latest technology.

# The Advantages of Blockchain

Here are a few more advantages of blockchain financial services that we haven’t covered yet.

**Micropayments**

Certain blockchain networks make it financially feasible to send micropayments as small as just ten or twenty cents. Granted, this is not possible with every network. For example, on Bitcoin, the typical fee is a few dollars. However, on other networks, the fees are so small that micropayments are a possibility.

**Full Financial Access**

Anyone in the world can access financial services that are built on the blockchain. All you need is a way to get a bit of crypto, and then you can participate in these ecosystems.

Blockchain banking is much more inclusive than the traditional banking system, which shuts billions of people out because they don’t have the right documents.

**Bitcoin is an Independent Currency**

Out of all the blockchains, Bitcoin is the most secure. Bitcoin is not controlled by any state, organization or company. It’s a currency outside of the jurisdiction of nation states.

Bitcoin’s supply cannot be inflated, and governments cannot take Bitcoin from people who are holding it. This makes Bitcoin an elegant solution for citizens living under repressive regimes.

# The Future is Blockchain Banking

Blockchain banking is the way of the future. Building a financial system on top of the blockchain offers so many benefits that there’s no way the legacy system is going to survive.

It might take a decade or two to transition fully to blockchain, but the process has already started. We’re currently experiencing mass Bitcoin adoption, DeFi is taking off, and multiple countries are talking about creating their own Central Bank Digital Currencies. The future of financial services is coming, and it’s coming fast.

I know, because I am susceptible to this as well. It’s only natural to want that winning ticket but the more time I spend investing the clearer it becomes, it starts with hard work. You’ve got to say yes to opportunities when they are presented and be okay with possible failure. Most importantly though, don’t settle once you get a taste of success. I’ve come from very little and am on track for a 6 figure year for the first time in my life. I still drive a car I paid $3400 for 6 years ago. 

Before enlightenment,
Chop wood, carry water;
After enlightenment,
Chop wood, carry water

Once you have that base it makes it easier to jump at opportunities like the last/current bull market without over extending yourself. Keep working and I hope everyone’s favorite coin makes them money.

You watch a few videos and take a quiz or just google the answers and take the quiz straight away like most people do.

Anyway, as I was taking the new PPAY one it got me thinking - Coinmarketcap already has your email and kinda knows how many of which coins you hold (given that you actually keep track of your portfolio there). The quiz also gives you your Binance ID (which is linked to your actual ID) and ETH wallet address. All this data about you would be next to impossible to connect otherwise, and they suddenly have it all in one place. And you gave that all away for a promise of a few $ worth of a potential shitcoin...

Only time will tell what Coinmarketcap will do with all that info on you. Share it with your local tax inspector? ""Leak"" (sell) it to the dark web? Or probably nothing.

If it smells fishy to you too, these are the precautions you can take just in case: 

\- if you're planning to use a blockchain (ETH) address for a secret stash – don't let it be traced to your ID: avoid direct transactions from any KYC (Know Your Customer) Centralized Exchange (CEX) to it, and certainly don't expose it for giveaways along with your email or other personal info;

\- use different emails for registering on each CEX and another separate one for portfolio trackers (such as CMC), giveaways and airdrops;

\- the only missing piece of the puzzle is your phone number – keep it safe and never reveal the phone number you used to create a CEX account anywhere crypto-related;

\- enable authenticator 2FA, not SMS.

Instead, start with dollar-cost average purchases every week or every paycheck. Something you won't miss or won't sting if it all goes down 50% to 80% one day. If that's $10 dollars at a time for you then start with that, if it's $50 dollars at a time for you then go with that. Let that grow and work for you. It will motivate you to study Bitcoin to see why the value grows like it does once you see your own invested value starting to move up. Once you understand it enough to know why you hodl despite the temporary early-day volatility, then I would say it's okay to throw in such large amounts.

Invest responsibly people, only invest what your level of knowledge of an asset can tolerate. Use your investments to grow interested in an asset so you're motivated to look into it and understand it. Make your first dollars like a scouting party, have them go in and report back what they learn, and only after you've fully understood an asset thanks to the interest your scouts grow in your mind into understanding the asset's underlying fundamentals, only then should you invest with what that higher level of your knowledge of the asset will allow you to do so. This way, can you become the next Warren Buffet talking down to quantum coin buyers in 80 years or whatever the heck the next big money-making revolutionary network will be.

As for where to onboard, that depends on where you live. If you're in America, then your best bet is a place like Coinbase Pro. Free to use, and their fee for a $10 dollar buy is only around 5 cents. You can also use blockfi since they have no fees, but they tend to have a hefty markup.

We had good spirits and I felt the urge to ask my notary what she thought of Blockchain as a way of securing data, since that is precisely what notaries do…

She said she wasn’t worried, that a notary still has many benefits that the blockchain can’t provide, etc. 
We talked about this for about ten minutes, but that isn’t the thing that’s important here. 

My notary is quite old, 60-65, and she immediately knew what I was talking about, so that means something. 

Go ask the average 60-65 year old what the blockchain even is and you probably won’t get an answer. 

The fact she knew what it was, discussed it with me and made an argumented claim on how it was no threat means she thought about it, possibly it is a (hot) topic amongst notaries in general?

Blockchain and thus Crypto is even bigger than we all may believe it to be…

One of the tweets under particular scrutiny is one Musk dashed off in May 2020, in which he wrote that Tesla’s stock price was “too high imo.” Twenty minutes after Musk published the tweet, Tesla stocks — valued at roughly $760 a share prior to the post — infamouslytook a tumble, dropping down to $722, a five percent decrease. The other tweet regulators say ran afoul of the agreement was a reply published in July of 2019 in which Musk proclaimed that Tesla wasaiming to make 1,000 solar roofs per week by the end of that year and“spooling up production line rapidly,” in an effort to meet that goal.

According to the SEC, Tesla’s lawyers failed to properly vet both tweets, which both run afoul of the Commission’s attempts to curtail public messages that pertain to “production numbers or sales or delivery numbers.”

“In the face of Mr. Musk’s repeated refusals to submit his covered written communications on Twitter to Tesla for pre-approval, we are very concerned by Tesla’s repeated determinations that there have been no policy violations because of purported carve-outs,” the SEC wrote in its May 2020 letter.

The ramped up SEC scrutiny follows an enforcement action the oversight agency took against Tesla in 2018 in which it alleged that Musk had committed fraud after he tweeted, “funding secured,” in reference to a potential buyout of the company. (The funding had, incidentally , not been secured as of that writing.) In response, the agency  charged Musk with securities fraud , and he and Tesla each paid $20 million apiece to settle the case out of court, in addition to Musk agreeing to relinquish his chairman role at Tesla andhave lawyers vet his public statements about the company going forward.

I considered putting this in one of the more beginner subs since a lot of people who’ve been into crypto for a little while already know about them and it’s not the most advanced concept on the planet, but it’s not exactly the first thing I’d introduce to someone *brand* new to crypto either. 

I see a lot of posts about DCA and that’s a great concept, but I see quite a few people in comments here who weren’t even know Coinbase pro is free (I didn’t either for my first couple months), and not a lot about limit orders, so I thought I’d share this here:  

First of all, as mentioned, Coinbase pro is free, and the fees are *significantly* cheaper, so even if you don’t want to do limit orders after you know what they are, if you’re using regular Coinbase, you might want to consider switching over. You don’t have to make a new account. If you use another exchange, most of them have this feature too.

But if you’re checking the charts compulsively hoping you luck into coming across the best time to buy or sell anything (or god forbid, trying to catch the bottom or top of a wick in real-time), limit orders are gonna save you a lot of time and stress since you’ll be able to buy and sell almost passively, and take a lot of the emotional temptation out of the equation in the process. 

If you’re new to buying and selling like this, it can seem a little daunting at first, so you’ll probably want to pull up a quick tutorial (just search limit orders and your favorite exchange on youtube and there should be plenty), but believe me, it’s going to be worth the 10 mins of time invested. But if you’ve never heard of limit orders, basically it’s a way you specify the price at which you want to buy or sell something, and then you can just set an order and then just go about your day, go to bed, whatever, and if the coin hits that number, your order gets filled. 

Basic strategy ideas:

Personally, aside from saving me quite a few late nights trying to stay up for the best prices, I find the most utility in the short term with setting a couple ridiculously high or low orders (around 10-30%) above or below the current price, because especially with alts, and *especially* with BTC pairs, you’re probably well aware prices flash up or down for a time so short there’s virtually no way you could catch it manually. But with limit orders you can, and now if you set an order at the right level, you have the opportunity to either catch a buy and almost instantly be 10+% up, or sell on a wick and almost instantly be that much closer to profitable reentry point if that’s your thing, or you can just take your profits and move on to the next thing more efficiently.

As for the longer term, in anticipation of pumps or dips like the one we had recently, if you think the price will *ever* hit a certain level, you can more or less just set it and forget it. I usually like to do some super basic TA and look for support and resistance levels. If it’s a buy, I’ll set it barely above support, if it’s a sell, I’ll set it just barely below. 

This way you can spend a few mins looking at the daily chart, split up your buys like a DCA, and set up everything you’re ready to spending one sitting instead of trying to time the market, and it’s more potentially profitable than just a blind automatic DCA at regular intervals. 

After you’re all set, you can cut the amount of times you have to check the charts down to a fraction, and at the same time you’ll almost definitely notice you’re more profitable than when you *were* compulsively checking the charts every 5 mins (although no guarantee you still won’t). 

At that point all you’ll need to do is check the status of your orders much less frequently and then either reassess what you want to do in the short term as things change, or if you’re just investing for the long haul, kick back after you’ve made the move you want to make.

That’s pretty much it, just wanted to let anyone know about this who didn’t already since I wish I found out about limit orders much sooner than I had.
