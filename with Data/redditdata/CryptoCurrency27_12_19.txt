Ethereum made one mistake, talking about its future contributions before people could fully perceive them. for anyone that believes ethereum is undervalued it is my opinion you cannot comprehend abstract ideas or conceptualize what ehtereum and blockchain technology actually is.

cryptocurrencies as a digital asset are cool, fun to play with and not typically a bad investment as they are based off the value of bitcoin.

bitcoin as a form of currency has its place and will more than likely ( by means of Litecoin ) aquire a 50 billion dollar market share of cross border money transfer services current rates require 10%+ of the sent value. litecoin does this for about 1%-10% of that. (0.01%-1% and in actuality less in most cases ) divide 84 million coins (max available at production end) by 500 billion (yearly cross border money transfers) roughly $4500 per coin is the minimum value of each coin to cover just one year of money transfers. rest assured it will be higher.

ethereum is efficiency , it is balance, equality, cooperation, innovation, security, and accountability. Ethereum is progress in the name of the greater good of all mankind not just the elite. Ethereum is a social Democracy

all of this sounds nice .... which is what Ethereum promises. people need proof before investing. and that is why you will be just a moment to late. because once it's a sure thing everyone will be investing.

blockchain technology is the real use of digital assets. imagine the following, all media content can be easily published on the blockchain providing two advantages, instant alert to its previous creation if applicable (through the entire database being accessible for instant search and comparison of all published media ) instant encryption ensuring piracy is lessened ( future application software will not be downloadable its code will exist in the ethereum ""cloud based"" network) the media can be viewed, shared, or done with as is desired, but only to the limits permitted by its creator and only when accessed through a supported ethereum network affiliate using ethereums ""Token"" to powe rthe software allowing the creator of the content to share their creation. furthermore the creator is capable of issuing their own proprietary tokens that allow them to essentially grant access to their creation to anyone in posession of their ""token""

The reason that you cannot comprehend Ethereum is the same reason your parents dont understand bitcoin, why your grandma will never comprehend the internet, why her mother doubted electricity, and her mother didnt see how coal could move a 50 ton train. that reason ? you are all just one generation behind in respect to grasping the concept, for which you have nothing to base its technology off of Ethereum is the next step in innovation. we all wondered what form the next leap in progress would take every great leap in technology is not recognized immediately but when initiated they cannot be stopped. the chain cannot be stopped it just moves forward. building on every advancement that comes before it.

whatare these apps ?.....

medical information will be on ethereum network.... the entire medical database of the world will be connected. acting as a living network updated instantaneously patients symptoms will have quantifiable values, vital statistics will be available for every patient that has ever had the symptoms that any given patient comes in with. by inputting the data of a patient the network uses event related probability to calculate a given set of all possible cases where the data matched with other patients ( millions of variables are considered in an instant.) to diagnose and treat patients according to the most succesful course of action as time goes on after years of trial and error the data will eventually reach a near 100% success rate. faster than we ever thought possible.

Television. cable will end see my remaining thoughts down below for why. netflix style content will replace it. tokens will be distributed. by movie producers meaning a handful of affiliates have access to the rights to distribute them. and netflix will require you to buy its token to have access.

pandora style radio tokens

gps tokens,

but why ?

by making specific tokens account for specific services we can prevent inflation. we also give a value to our money supply. remember when we had money backed by gold ? a dollar could be exchanged for its value in gold. well thats your answer. we have returned to a barter system where i can trade my own services for your services or a future promise that you can at any time redeem said token for my service, or trade for other services. ultimately our money can be thought of as bitcoin and the gold is all other coins. fiat or at least a hard money currency will always exist although two things will occur because of that. people will not be as likely to keep large amounts of money outside of the system as it will depreciate. in most cases over long periods of time. take 10 dollars out for a year and when you come back to buy the equivelent in bitcoin you will likely receive less than if it stayd in the system. where as hard currency versions of bitcoin will retain their value. that theory should hold until 2041 when all coins have been mined and by that time i would bet everyone has jumpedon board. and global currencies will have traded in their fiatmoney to make huge gains from the appreciation of bitcoin integration. i believe bitcoin will be more than an investment it is a replacement as well as a return to the gold standard.

if my outlook holds true then wewill all get an identity token. with that token you can vote on everything from what to spend the pto funds on to what roads need to be built in your city to whether that 150 million dollars should go towards researching the effects of mustard gas on purple monkeys or if it might be better served providing 2 and a half million children with water that hasnt been filled with biological waste. or maybe to give power to 20 million human beings that have lived their entire life without it.

we will have a global currency (bitcoin) and all goods and services will add to its overall marketcap. one services sucess adds to the value of all services. if you do roofing in the the summer your toens will be more valuable. if people cant afford your service then they can contribute to the mining of that service if you allow it. if yoou want to support a cause like funding research on autism then you can go and buy their coin. their service is to find a cure and if its important to people then they will continue to do so. if it is meaningless we as a society will not buy their coin and they will have to find a new job, or keep it as a hobby. either way its not up to a group of people that find it unnecessary it is the decision of the entire world as a collective entity.

many will read what i am about to say and it will cause everything i have said to be no longer looked at as credible. for this i am sorry that you are unable to think of anyone in this world but yourself, and it is people like you that have brought us to this point. socialism always failed in the worlds eyes as did communism. on paper the greatest civilization and its structure are ones in which people work together and do not worry about accumulating wealth in order to live in excess. the wealth is distributed equally, some positions which are harder to fill or require more skills will in the end offer higher pay for their tokens but only because there will be a supply and demand effect created due to its nature of less people being capable of supplying that service/good. on the flip side i believe that by the same token certain positions will ultimately demand a far higher pay. do you want to clean shit out of a porta potty ? probably not so when you need someone else to do it guess what you are going to pay that guy/girl exactly what it costs to have someone do it or you can do it yourself either way supply and demand dictates the value and the most agreed upon value between the provider and the consumer will prevail.

The value of Token originates from the resources consumed by mining rather than the concept of ideology. This is the current status. Miners choose to mine because of the existence of benefits, rather than contributing charity to the circulation of Token.

From the perspective of the blockchain, the continuous improvement of the consensus mechanism has the greatest impact on the incentive layer, so the consensus mechanism determines how to mine.

The essence of the blockchain is a ledger. It does not bring its own decentralized attributes. Only when a consensus mechanism is added can the blockchain achieve decentralization.

The distributed existence of nodes allows rights to return to individuals, and each node verifies transactions, and the object is a consistent ledger, so there is no conflict. The existence of a consensus mechanism is to solve the problem of ledger consistency.

In fact, it can be more simply understood that the consensus mechanism is a rule that everyone can recognize, and everyone can follow this rule so that everyone can get a fair return.

Since the creation of BTC, the consensus mechanism has also gone through 10 years. Although more than 30 consensus mechanisms have appeared in these 10 years, in general, there are only a few mainstream consensuses in the crypto world.

1. POW-Proof of Work
2. POS-Proof of Stake
3. DPOS-Delegated Proof of Stake
4. POC-Proof of Capacity

**Origin of consensus mechanism**

The POW is that more work can get more distribution. High-intensity decentralization has given it high security, but its inefficient transaction and the huge amount of energy consumed by mining have always been criticized, and the mining pool will still lead to centralization after it has mastered most of the computing power.

A group of farmers who only have sickle, whoever contributes more, whoever gets more, everyone has the right to participate in meetings and elections, and everyone has the right to speak. However, the efficiency of using only a sickle to work is extremely low, so some farmers began to buy machines to work, but the price of the machines is very expensive, not everyone can afford, so the farmers who have machines at home will get more returns.

**Development of consensus mechanism**

PoS is to obtain the right to package the block by staking tokens. During the transaction process, the system rewards the nodes that package and verify the block. The source of the reward is additional or unlock of the token.

POW is that compares the computing power to obtain the block's bookkeeping right, while POS compares the number of coins held by the miner to obtain the block's bookkeeping right. The more coins the miner holds, the more likely it is to obtain the bookkeeping right. Bigger. The whole process will not involve calculations and will not waste resources, shorten the time to reach consensus, significantly increase the speed of transactions, and at the same time, shortcomings will begin to appear, such as weakened decentralization and security issues.

Everyone is a farmer with sickles. As a result, someone suddenly bought a machine to work, and the efficiency and income improved. The farmers became rich farmers. Therefore, at the meeting, the rich farmers had a clearer voice than ordinary farmers.

**Improvement of consensus mechanism**

On the basis of POS, a DPOS has appeared, which is similar to the representative system. The token holders are elected as nodes, and then the nodes vote for selection, and then supernodes are generated, and these supernodes are responsible for verification and registration so that they get rewards. This approach greatly reduces the number of nodes participating in verification and accounting and improves efficiency and performance again, but in essence, this is inconsistent with the concept of decentralization and belongs to a small range of centralization. The security coefficient is extremely low.

When it comes to elections, not everyone has the right to vote. Instead, the representatives of each village vote and the individual rights are replaced by small groups.

The POC is an algorithm that uses the computer's hard disk space to store mining data to mine for a profit. It generates a large number of pseudo-random numbers through a certain algorithm and then packs these random numbers into hard disk space to compete in the block. When competing rights, miners only need to scan the data in the hard disk space.

Such block generation is determined by the storage density of the hard disk space, which physically limits the generation of blocks, guarantees the security of the blocks, and finally allows the entire blockchain to reach consensus.

Some people have developed a new type of crop. Just plant it in the field, and when it rains there, there can grow crops there. The more farmland, the greater the number and probability of crops growing in the field. Everyone is very happy because the machines are so expensive that ordinary people can't afford them, and now they just have to wait for the rain.

Judging from the development history of mining, as long as the market value of the traditional POW workload proof mechanism reaches a certain level, it will be ASIC. As long as the economic value of Token exists, the ASIC mining machine will always cause a waste of resources and environmental pollution.

In this case, the advantages of the POC algorithm are extremely obvious:

**1. Low threshold for mining, wide audience**

The price of hard disks is low. Everyone can buy one to participate in mining, and the supply of hard disks is stable. This determines that POC mining can participate at any time, regardless of the time of participation.

**2. High mining efficiency and low energy consumption**

Compared with CPU, GPU, and ASIC mining machines, the hard disks used for POC hard disk mining have an average power consumption of only 8 \~ 14W. Lower electricity costs allow miners to earn more, which is one of the reasons why more and more POW miners participate in POC hard disk mining.

**3. Ecological development is more** **positive**

Traditional POW miners will have to sell tokens more or less because of electricity bills. In the POC, electricity bills are extremely low and the existence of a mortgage mechanism will allow miners to hold tokens for higher returns, the miners become an ecological builder, which avoids the project failure caused by the early miners who obtained a large number of tokens at a very low cost to sell in bulk.

Currently, there are very few currencies mined based on the POC consensus algorithm. Recently, the more popular Diskcoin has been developing steadily and continuously under the circumstances of a bad environment. This also proves the stubborn vitality of the POC currency from the side. Even though the current POC crypto market is generally underperforming, I still believe that the emergence of POC hard disk mining is to give ordinary people a chance to get rich, and Diskcoin is a good choice!"|True|False|[]|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|953256|public|self|POC - Changing Consensus with Hard disk|0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/eg4lt9/poc_changing_consensus_with_hard_disk/|all_ads|6|1577392036.0|||||||||||||||2019-12-27 01:57:16+00:00|t3_eg4lt9|0|1|1.0||

One of the main FUDs this sub likes to talk about is LN as if Satoshi didn't want this to be created. WRONG.  
 Satoshi said this in 2010 - ""The design outlines a lightweight client that does not need the full block chain. In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification. The lightweight client can send and receive transactions, it just can't generate blocks. It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself. The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed. For now, everyone just runs a full network node."" If you don't see how this is the LN that Satoshi anticipated than you might be delusional.  
  
To further digress on that a bit - ""I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less. It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in. The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions."" He already knew most people will be using the second layer.  
  
The second biggest FUD would be the block size. The 'satoshivision' fan boys claim that it was apart of Satoshi's vision to not bring out innovation and stick to the bitcoin core client and increase it's blocksize when needed however this is also wrong.  
-""The threshold can easily be changed in the future. We can decide to increase it when the time comes. It's a good idea to keep it lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed. If we hit the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual use. Keeping the threshold lower would help limit the amount of wasted disk space in that event.""  Anyone with common sense would acknowledge that the 2017 bull run was just a FLOOD like satoshi mentioned. And it literally was, anyone who was here would recall the Bitcoin network was under heavy attacks and was being spammed by thousands of penny transactions. During all of this drama is when the 'satoshivision fan boys' started coming out trying to call a flipenning. If you don't see how this was a fraudulent attempt to take over, than again you might be delusional. Bitcoin block size did increase by very little but just like satoshi's actual vision, it's been kept low because we don't actually need to increase it. Best to work on innovation than to take the easy route and only increase if ACTUALLY needed and not just because floods are happening.   
  
  
The 3rd major FUD attacks on Bitcoin in this sub is based on the mining. People in this sub really think China will overtake the network which is another delusion.  
-""The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU proof-of-worker than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth."" China would never try to overtake the network. It literally makes no sense. China is about greed and this kind of attack would lose A LOT of money. Not only that, but even if overtaking the network you still can't do anything really! You can't steal anybodies coins. The most you can do is buy something online and than overtake the network so you can double spend and essentially get your money back even though you used it. But you cannot touch anybody's wallets so again it makes zero sense to believe China would ever attempt something like this which makes no sense. All China wants is more money. They will continue to grow there farms essentially making bitcoin stronger.  
  
To digress a bit further - ""There would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to overproof-of-worker the network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins. The smaller farms are then the ""honest nodes"". (I need a better term than ""honest"") The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the bar gets to overproof-of-worker the network, making larger farms also too small to overproof-of-worker it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too. According to the ""long tail"" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put together should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.""   
  
""Even if a bad guy does overproof-of-worker the network, it's not like he's instantly rich. All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent, like bouncing a check. To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overproof-of-worker the network and try to take his money back. I don't think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins. With a zombie farm that big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.""
  

Most of the FUDers here are just moonboys who think they will get BIG profits short term. Be realistic assholes, Bitcoin is a 5-10 year investment. Yeah that's **years**.  This FUD won't be relevant in 5-10 years and it's still not even relevant today when you take into consideration the bigger picture of bitcoins development."|True|False|[]|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|953281|public|self|The Bitcoin FUD in this sub is ironic when you actually look at Satoshi's REAL vision|0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/eg7d8q/the_bitcoin_fud_in_this_sub_is_ironic_when_you/|all_ads|6|1577407199.0||dark|||||||||38521cf8-291e-11e5-aaf3-0ee61c357d3b||||2019-12-27 06:09:59+00:00|t3_eg7d8q|0|0|0.42||

Ethereum made one mistake, talking about its future contributions before people could fully perceive them. for anyone that believes ethereum is undervalued it is my opinion you cannot comprehend abstract ideas or conceptualize what ehtereum and blockchain technology actually is.

cryptocurrencies as a digital asset are cool, fun to play with and not typically a bad investment as they are based off the value of bitcoin.

bitcoin as a form of currency has its place and will more than likely ( by means of Litecoin ) aquire a 50 billion dollar market share of cross border money transfer services current rates require 10%+ of the sent value. litecoin does this for about 1%-10% of that. (0.01%-1% and in actuality less in most cases ) divide 84 million coins (max available at production end) by 500 billion (yearly cross border money transfers) roughly $4500 per coin is the minimum value of each coin to cover just one year of money transfers. rest assured it will be higher.

ethereum is efficiency , it is balance, equality, cooperation, innovation, security, and accountability. Ethereum is progress in the name of the greater good of all mankind not just the elite. Ethereum is a social Democracy

all of this sounds nice .... which is what Ethereum promises. people need proof before investing. and that is why you will be just a moment to late. because once it's a sure thing everyone will be investing.

blockchain technology is the real use of digital assets. imagine the following, all media content can be easily published on the blockchain providing two advantages, instant alert to its previous creation if applicable (through the entire database being accessible for instant search and comparison of all published media ) instant encryption ensuring piracy is lessened ( future application software will not be downloadable its code will exist in the ethereum ""cloud based"" network) the media can be viewed, shared, or done with as is desired, but only to the limits permitted by its creator and only when accessed through a supported ethereum network affiliate using ethereums ""Token"" to powe rthe software allowing the creator of the content to share their creation. furthermore the creator is capable of issuing their own proprietary tokens that allow them to essentially grant access to their creation to anyone in posession of their ""token""

The reason that you cannot comprehend Ethereum is the same reason your parents dont understand bitcoin, why your grandma will never comprehend the internet, why her mother doubted electricity, and her mother didnt see how coal could move a 50 ton train. that reason ? you are all just one generation behind in respect to grasping the concept, for which you have nothing to base its technology off of Ethereum is the next step in innovation. we all wondered what form the next leap in progress would take every great leap in technology is not recognized immediately but when initiated they cannot be stopped. the chain cannot be stopped it just moves forward. building on every advancement that comes before it.

whatare these apps ?.....

medical information will be on ethereum network.... the entire medical database of the world will be connected. acting as a living network updated instantaneously patients symptoms will have quantifiable values, vital statistics will be available for every patient that has ever had the symptoms that any given patient comes in with. by inputting the data of a patient the network uses event related probability to calculate a given set of all possible cases where the data matched with other patients ( millions of variables are considered in an instant.) to diagnose and treat patients according to the most succesful course of action as time goes on after years of trial and error the data will eventually reach a near 100% success rate. faster than we ever thought possible.

Television. cable will end see my remaining thoughts down below for why. netflix style content will replace it. tokens will be distributed. by movie producers meaning a handful of affiliates have access to the rights to distribute them. and netflix will require you to buy its token to have access.

pandora style radio tokens

gps tokens,

but why ?

by making specific tokens account for specific services we can prevent inflation. we also give a value to our money supply. remember when we had money backed by gold ? a dollar could be exchanged for its value in gold. well thats your answer. we have returned to a barter system where i can trade my own services for your services or a future promise that you can at any time redeem said token for my service, or trade for other services. ultimately our money can be thought of as bitcoin and the gold is all other coins. fiat or at least a hard money currency will always exist although two things will occur because of that. people will not be as likely to keep large amounts of money outside of the system as it will depreciate. in most cases over long periods of time. take 10 dollars out for a year and when you come back to buy the equivelent in bitcoin you will likely receive less than if it stayd in the system. where as hard currency versions of bitcoin will retain their value. that theory should hold until 2041 when all coins have been mined and by that time i would bet everyone has jumpedon board. and global currencies will have traded in their fiatmoney to make huge gains from the appreciation of bitcoin integration. i believe bitcoin will be more than an investment it is a replacement as well as a return to the gold standard.

if my outlook holds true then wewill all get an identity token. with that token you can vote on everything from what to spend the pto funds on to what roads need to be built in your city to whether that 150 million dollars should go towards researching the effects of mustard gas on purple monkeys or if it might be better served providing 2 and a half million children with water that hasnt been filled with biological waste. or maybe to give power to 20 million human beings that have lived their entire life without it.

we will have a global currency (bitcoin) and all goods and services will add to its overall marketcap. one services sucess adds to the value of all services. if you do roofing in the the summer your toens will be more valuable. if people cant afford your service then they can contribute to the mining of that service if you allow it. if yoou want to support a cause like funding research on autism then you can go and buy their coin. their service is to find a cure and if its important to people then they will continue to do so. if it is meaningless we as a society will not buy their coin and they will have to find a new job, or keep it as a hobby. either way its not up to a group of people that find it unnecessary it is the decision of the entire world as a collective entity.

many will read what i am about to say and it will cause everything i have said to be no longer looked at as credible. for this i am sorry that you are unable to think of anyone in this world but yourself, and it is people like you that have brought us to this point. socialism always failed in the worlds eyes as did communism. on paper the greatest civilization and its structure are ones in which people work together and do not worry about accumulating wealth in order to live in excess. the wealth is distributed equally, some positions which are harder to fill or require more skills will in the end offer higher pay for their tokens but only because there will be a supply and demand effect created due to its nature of less people being capable of supplying that service/good. on the flip side i believe that by the same token certain positions will ultimately demand a far higher pay. do you want to clean shit out of a porta potty ? probably not so when you need someone else to do it guess what you are going to pay that guy/girl exactly what it costs to have someone do it or you can do it yourself either way supply and demand dictates the value and the most agreed upon value between the provider and the consumer will prevail."|True|False|[]|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|953212|public|self|My Ethereum Predictions From 2017.

However the reason for terminating was valid and his account was given back and I think he's one of the most respectable finance people in todays age.  
  
What I noticed over the past year, on nearly every youtube crypto guy, is the comment sections being INFESTED with scammers/impersonators and these impersonators do a really good damn job going as far as having full blown conversations with themselves using other accounts which look legit and even feel legit. Very easy scams to the normies.  
  
I suspect over the past year or so, reports been coming in heavy to youtube forcing them to 'act'.  The action wasn't 100% on point as they mis-banned a lot of people mistaking them for the scammers which in actuality the scammers were in the comment sections.  
  
Whoever is a LEGIT youtuber, if there account was terminated they most likely will get it back. However if any LEGIT youtuber doesn't get his/her account back, Then I would be worried.  
  
  
So how much do we know about legit youtubers being ban? So far it seems like a lot of these so called legit youtubers are shills. They aren't teaching much about the actual technology and they aren't really teaching much about real finance advice and how trading really works. For reference, check out Alessio Rastani's channel. He has a legit finance channel that really does teach about investing/trading because he himself is a legitimate professional and not some random young youtuber who's really just trying to make it by being entertaining oppose to sharing knowledge.  
  
  My conclusion is that Youtube had to act quickly on the mass reports which led to many faulty bans which is essentially a mistake within there system of how they handle these reports.

So, I watched the buy and sell price, and they didn't move, but the ""Trades"" for the pair kept showing buys and sells around where the price marker is at.  I decided to play a little game.  I started making buys just under the lowest trade value, making my way all the way up to a buy higher than the 24-hour high.  I now have a buy for 1.000 TUSD for 1.0085 USDT at 1.0085 and it hasn't been bought in over 30 minutes.  The ""Trades"" have completely stopped.  The klines for the 1-minute graph have completely stopped.  There are sells building at 1.0086, but still no Trades.  I bet if I cancel my buy, the data will fill in, but look at this:

I traded the rest of my balance for XRP, transferred it off.  Be careful out there.

I hope this kind of question is allowed.

So, I'm building a fictional world, a Cyberpunk one actually. And the world itself, at least one of the political entities has 0 standing government and is basically an uber-libertarian landscape, where the official unwritten law is ""You can do anything if no one stops you, or no one *can* stop you."" This got me to figure out how the economy function and that made me realize: Crypto Currency is inherently decentralized and in a world with no central authority, this would probably arise.

But then I encountered a problem: What would an economy run entirely on CryptoCurrency even look like? While I understand the fundamental gist of the system, the wider effects I'm unsure about. How would one go about making small scale purchases vs. large scale, i.e. buying a loaf of bread vs. an apartment complex? What would crime look like in this new world, white collar, petty thievery, and more? Could stealing a wallet have the same effect as it does today? 

One thing I figured is that there would be large scale Mining corporations would probably double as """"banks"""". They check all the transactions made across the city, and communicate with various entities be it fellow corporations or individuals about loans, payments, etc. They wouldn't be the sole producer or controller of the currency, they would just have such a stockpile that they're the ones who can conceivably run such a thing.

But with that said, if a currency has an upper limit (like how supposedly Bitcoin has a max of 21 mil) how could people akin to Bezos and Gates exist? Would they be judged on divisions instead? 

Apologies on if this has been asked before at all. I came to this conclusion on the basis of a handful of YT videos that say how a currency works, but not the effects of adopting such a system on a wide scale."|True|False|[]|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|953200|public|self|I'm doing some world building and I came to the conclusion that some form of CryptoCurrency would run the entire economy.
