The basics of moon farming are simple, get more upvotes to earn more moons.

Now to see how we can get more upvotes, let's examine what are the top post on r/cc 

&amp;#x200B;

|Top Post Today|up votes received|
|:-|:-|
|complaining about bank transfers|3,368|
|Rant about r/cc giving bad advice|3,121|

&amp;#x200B;

|Top Post this year|up votes received|
|:-|:-|
|you hear about the kid who put $500 into a meme coin and made 100K, but you don't hear about the hundreds who lost $1,000|53,900|
|Binance CEO throwing Shade at Elon|45,500|
|Classic rug pull Comedy post - stating they are selling only to switch it at the end and say ""only to buy more crypto""|45,500|

so looking at these we begin to see a pattern, the most up voted post are ones that get emotional reactions from from the readers. Most people can relate to hardships with banks or the pain of missing out on a project. 

Another thing we notice is that readers up vote rags to riches story's, people like to see the underdog win. They also like to see rich snobs get put in their place by other rich snobs, so post about one millionaire calling out another one can be good for moon farming.

News and Technical analysis also seem to get lucky sometimes and make it to the top, but not as often as you would think. Below I have assembled a list of key words and phrases to include in your title's to help get those Moon's.

&amp;#x200B;

|Elon|Moons|GME|LRC|Matic|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ALGO|Algorand|WE ALGO|Silvio Macali|meme coin|
|Rug Pull|unpopular opinion|popular opinion|HODL|DCA|
|Bitcoin|ETH|Ethereum|Vitalik|when moon|
|El Salvador|NFT dumb|Government bad|I Hate Taxes|taxes are robbery|

If you have gotten this far then you are really dedicated to becoming a real life moon farmer and you want to one day make your living shit posting on Reddit. I can not guarantee your success, I can only show you what seems to work for other.

* Post and interesting news article (search before posting news articles, they get posted multiple times)
* post about a celebrity using crypto (this one work some times)
* post a rug pull story
* unpopular and popular opinions seem to be loosing popularity (proceed with caution)
* Rag to riches story will work 50% of the time
* If all else fails, post about moon week (This one always works, just make sure no one else has posted it in the last 2 hours)

Remember that although moon farming is difficult work, one day it will pay off (it might not, nobody actually knows if moons will ever have any real value)

If you read this entire post, you are now an official moon farmer.

This is aimed at being educational (not financial advice) so there is no TL;DR. If you want to learn more about DeFi read on.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago I made a post about DeFi and why folks should be paying attention to it and it got a decent amount of attention. A comment I saw come up quite a bit was how people still didn't really understand what exploring the DeFi space meant. There seemed to be interest in learning more about DeFi but not a lot of resources on getting started. Therefore I decided to write a multipart series breaking down DeFi for newcomers and explaining how to actually use the space. This first part will really focus on what Defi is and define a few things to get us all on the same page.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is DeFi? Defi is a movement that allows people to use financial services (borrowing, lending, trading) without the need of a centralized entity like a bank. These services are generally provided by Decentralized Apps (DApps), generally deployed on the Ethereum Network.

&amp;#x200B;

So we know what DeFi is but that's still pretty broad. So what are all the parts of DeFi? Good question. Let's break it down into several categories.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Stablecoins - coins that are pegged to stable assets such as the US dollar. USDT is by far the most popular in terms of use but there are a few other options such as USDC, DAI, and BUSD. While stable coins are DApps themselves, they do make accessibility into DeFi easier since crypto can be extremely volatile
2. Lending and Borrowing - DeFi removes the restrictions that are created by banks when it comes to lending and borrowing money. It also allows people that don't have access to a bank the ability to lend and borrow. Things like credit score become irrelevant in this space. The only thing you need is crypto assets to participate. You can earn a yield by depositing assets and you can borrow against assets you stake in protocols.
3. Exchanges - Centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance work as intermediaries and custodians of traded assets. This means your assets are on their platform and they are technically in control of your assets (not your keys, not your crypto). DEXs (decentralized exchanges) allow users to exchange crypto without giving up custody of your coins. Since your funds stay with you, you don't need to trust that the exchange remains solvent.
4. Lottery - DeFi Lottery Daaps have started popping up as DeFi continues to disrupt finance. These Dapps allow users to pool their funds together and invest in a lending app earning interest. At a set interval a random winner is selected to win. all the funds earned in the pool. The ""tickets"" are then refunded to all participants creating a ""no-loss"" lottery. Sidenote: There is a loss here and that's the opportunity of earning those rewards by staking yourself.
5. Governance - this is the business management of crypto. Think like a board of directors except anyone who owns a governance token for an Daap has voting rights. 

There are a few other categories that can fall under the DeFi umbrella but these are in my opinion some of the more popular ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before we get into how to access Dapps and participate in Defi, we need to have an understanding of the Decentralized Layer. Many blockchains give people the ability to build Dapps using their blockchain but Ethereum is by far the most popular so let's start there. Ethereum allows software developers to write smart contracts on the Ethereum block chain. Smart Contracts is essentially a programmable contract that allows two parties to set conditions of a transaction without the trust of an outside party. For example, when you buy a home, a title company is generally responsible for the transfer of assets between both parties. A smart contract would eliminate the need for the title company and handle the transfer all on the blockchain.

Multiple smart contracts are combined together to work hand in hand to create a decentralized application (DApp). This allows Dapps to handle complex processes.

&amp;#x200B;

Dapps have a number of pros and cons to them just like most things in life.

**Advantages**

1. Immutability -  once it's deployed on the blockchain it cant be changed
2. Tamper-proof - cant be tampered with without everyone on the blockchain knowing
3. Transparency - they are openly auditable (many developers have third parties audit their code)
4. Availability - Dapps built on ETH will remain usable as long as ETH remains active

**Disadvantages**

1. Immutability - Human errors are common and as mentioned above, once deployed a contract can't be changed
2. Transparent - transparency can also lead to hackers finding exploits in the code
3. Scalability - Dapps are generally limited to the bandwidth available on the blockchain it lives on

A few example of Dapps include AAVE, MAKER, Compound, Anchor Protocol, and Curve Finance.

 Most Dapps are plug and play. You go to their site and you connect your wallet and you're good to use the platform. As far as wallets go, MetaMask is the most popular option available. If you don't have a MetaMask wallet I would recommend opening one up. Coinbase Wallet is also an option and for mobile Argent wallet is a good option.

In a later post I will go over how to participate in some of these protocols. Due to Ethereum gas fees this can be pretty expensive. Luckily, there are a few options to make this cheaper. Layer 2 solutions exist to help us out with this. Ill briefly discuss what Layer 1 and Layer 2.

**Layer 1 (L1)** \- this is the term used to describe the underlying main blockchain architecture. In our case this would be the Ethereum blockchain.

**Layer 2 (L2)** \- is the term used to describe a network built on top of another blockchain. Examples of this would be the Matic, Arbitrum, or Avalanche networks. They are all built on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows them access to all the Ethereum network provides such as liquidity. Fees are generally much lower on these networks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2 will go over some of these protocols, what they offer, and how to use them. So keep an eye out. If there is anything you'd like me to cover in this series or if there is anything you'd like for me to expand upon from this post feel free to ask below.

It is a way of distilling market information to make a better decision on purchasing or selling an asset.

In its purest form, it involves looking at a chart, identifying price trends, confirming if the trends you see are valid, and making a trading decision based on that info. Sounds great—look at the charts, figure out the future price. Easy enough. 

In reality, though, it’s a bit more tricky. Millions of market participants are playing the same game, all looking for an edge, all trading on their own psychology, with ridiculous amounts of static between the signal and you. 

# The Data Supporting Technical Analysis

A lot of more TradFi-type ETF investors will tell you that technical analysis is totally meaningless. I don’t think this is the case. Plenty of academic (and anecdotal) evidence tells us TA outperforms passive investing strategies.

Most data we have on the discipline comes from equity markets. While there are definitely academics that say TA is worthless, the following studies have all confirmed that basic TA can outperform passive strategies:

* Errunza and Losq ([1985](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037842668590007X?via%3Dihub))
* Urrutia ([1995](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6803.1995.tb00568.x)) 
* Sobreiro et al. ([2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062940816300742?via%3Dihub))
* Noakes and Rajaratnam ([2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10479-014-1751-y))

Most recently, 2018 study [de Souza, M.J.S., Ramos, D.G.F., Pena, M.G. *et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40854-018-0087-z) made the following conclusion on a broad review of TA strategies in BRICS equity markets:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“On average, the returns obtained using technical analysis surpassed the value invested.”

&amp;#x200B;

These studies sometimes contradict each other, but pretty much all of them have commonalities:

* TA is more effective when performed in less efficient markets 
* Higher frequency of trading is correlated with lower returns via TA
* TA aided by fundamental analysis is more effective
* TA is more effective in less mature markets

Perhaps these points help explain why TA is so effective in crypto markets, especially with altcoins. Altcoin markets are immature, less efficient, and can be evaluated fundamentally. Retail investors have a further advantage in that they don’t need to make frequent trades.

&amp;#x200B;

**When is Technical Analysis Valid?**

I don't think the average crypto investor can make their whole trading career out of technical analysis, but it can definitely help you:

* Inform longer-term investment decisions alongside fundamental analysis
* Help you time exits
* Get better entry points for swing trades.

All of these advantages are valuable enough that it’s worth understanding, at minimum, the basic foundations.

&amp;#x200B;

**A Note**

In this analysis, I’m going to be starting from the most basic technical analysis concepts. If you already understand technical analysis, this article might just be a way to brush up on the basics or one to skip.

## The Foundation: Supply and Demand

All technical analysis comes down to one thing: understanding supply and demand. If there are more buyers (demand) than sellers (supply), the price will move upwards. More demand than supply? The price will go up. Much of technical analysis comes down to identifying where that supply and demand lies and making your investment based on that info.

I find it a healthy exercise to reflect on the fact that, in every trade, there is one buyer and one seller: for any investment idea you have, there is someone on the other side thinking the exact opposite. And one of you will be wrong.  It's a humbling concept, but one that will definitely make you think twice.

## Resistance/Support

When a cryptocurrency bounces off a certain price level twice, that could indicate a place of resistance or support. That is to say, there are a lot of people looking to trade at that price and the crypto will have a harder time breaking out above or falling below.

**Resistance**

Resistance is the tendency for an asset to approach a given price and fall back down just before or right after hitting it. It often happens at round numbers, because sellers concentrate supply around prices like $100 or $1000 or $60,000. 

Check out the example below where Bitcoin bounced off of its previous all-time high (resistance) before breaking through:

&amp;#x200B;

**Support**

Once a crypto breaks through a resistance price level, it often becomes support. Support is a floor that an asset’s price bounces off of. This can represent a good buying opportunity because frequently, after a crypto makes this critical test, momentum changes. Many investors wait for that bounce to make a directional trade and buy at the lowest possible price.

For an example, check out the chart below for Ethereum, where it broke through, then bounced off, the $3,000 price level for a few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I like this tweet from Three Arrows Capital investor Su Zhu on trading support and resistance:

&amp;#x200B;

# Channels

Channels are just what they sound like, two wals of prices that an asset is range-bound within. 

Channels can trend up, down, or sideways. When channels trend sideways, it’s often seen as an opportunity to accumulate a crypto.

When these channels exist, there are a few possibilities for making money: 

* Make a trade at the bottom hoping for a bounce
* Make a trade at the top hoping for a rejection
* Make a directional trade after a breakout

https://preview.redd.it/w8fy2vef1g081.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f68aef02866051eb7d7e6faef6aef76af1e134d

# Breakouts

A breakout happens when a crypto moves above a support area or below a resistance area. When identified correctly, this tends to be accompanied by a big move, either up or down, and thus a big opportunity. It happens a lot when a crypto hits, and then passes, an all-time high.

Below is a chart of Bitcoin last year where it encountered resistance at its 2017 ATH, then broke out with a big move to the upside:

# Moving Averages

Like price levels of support and resistance, moving averages are often areas of resistance and support as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Simple Moving Average**

The concept of a simple moving average is, well, actually a little complicated: it is the “arithmetic moving average calculated by adding recent prices and then dividing that figure by the number of time periods in the calculation.” It's basically the average price over the last period of time, plotted on a continuous line. 

These moving averages end up being bands of prices that sit below the asset price in bullish times and above the asset price in bearish times.

If you’ve ever heard the term ‘death cross’ or ‘golden cross,’ it comes from moving averages. Golden crosses are when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average to the upside, and often signals a pump in price. Death crosses are when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average to the downside. 

You can see the chart below as an example of what moving averages look like on a chart as well as what it looks like when they cross.

**Exponential Moving Average**

The EMA is similar to the SMA, although it places more weight on recent prices. It’s used in a similar way, to find buy and sell signals when it serves as resistance or support or when it crosses another moving average.

## Volume 

You know those little bars at the bottom of a price chart, below the graph? Those bars reflect volume--the amount of a given cryptocurrency, in dollars, traded over a time period.  

Volume can help us detect momentum—a word used when a trend in a cryptocurrency is accompanied by large volume. 

Increased volume signals that whatever trend you're seeing is important. With more volume, we can see that more and more participants are pricing in new information, and that more participants are entering or exiting the market for that asset. 

A price drop on very low volume probably isn’t a huge reason to be concerned. A price drop on enormous volume means there’s something big happening. See the May Ethereum selloff for a good example of how high volume signaled a short bear market:

# RSI

RSI is a stat that ranges between 1 and 100 and attempts to show momentum. The calculation is a bit rough, but the basic idea is that if RSI is above 70, the crypto is overbought and might be due for a trend reversal. Below 30 and it could be undervalued, ready to pull out of a downward slide.

It's a bit more nuanced and must be used in conjunction with price data to be well understood. The fact that cryptos can remain 'overbought' or 'undervalued' for long periods of time makes it even more difficult to get right.

# Platforms for Technical Analysis

For charting, TradingView is definitely the most popular service and it’s free, although it’s got a premium subscription available. The charts in this article all came from TradingView. Coinigy and Cryptowat.ch are also well-known services. I'd recommend TradingView just because it's so widely used. 

# The Limitations (and Infinite Possibilities) of Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a tree that branches out in endless directions. On-chain analysts (market observers that look at public blockchain data) combine TA with other metrics. They combine these new metrics to make even more metrics derived from the first layer of TA statistics. It can make your head spin.

There are so many signals and patterns to identify that it often becomes difficult to find the patterns that are really important. As with everything, it comes down to practice, experience, introspection, research, and learning.

It’s really, really difficult to become a trader on solely technical analysis. When your money is on the line, it’s easy to get emotional or overinvested in a narrative. An altcoin that’s pumping is really hard to sell and will look like it can go forever. Stories can be constructed in your own head.

I think TA is best used in combination with other skills: position sizing, fundamental analysis, diversification, profit taking. It's another way to improve your arsenal as an investor, not a golden bullet.

Later, when I realized that this was not a good option, I decided to keep it for the long term and continue without taking any profit. 

After a long time, I bought a new coin -LRC. It was 0.97 when I bought it. While I had a good profit, I made no sales and I did not take any profits. Maybe this will work for me in the long run, but the psychological situation in the short run is a bit severe. 

If you have invested more than you can afford to lose, feel free to take a profit. Taking a profit is not a bad thing. Before investing in any coin, set a goal for yourself and know how to stop yourself when you reach that goal. You can evaluate the ideas of others, but do not put them ahead of your own.

How many newbies do you think actually keep their seed phrase in a locked safe, vs on a post it note on their desk?

Or how many beginners wrote it down on a torn piece of paper to keep inside their wallet just ready to get stolen?

As a semi-newbie I started on an exchange, learned about limit and market orders, looked up interesting projects, then bought my first crypto. That was A LOT of info to absorb and understand for me. 

It wasn't until a few months down the line when I became confident I knew about wallets and started storing crypto outside of exchanges. 

I hope most people are smarter than me, but if I tried to open a wallet right at the start then I probably would've kept the seed phrase in my wallet and not secure it properly.

But I realized that after the MAY crash earlier this year, my emotions spinning around like crazy is nowhere near sustainable.

I just decided to pick solid stuff I believe in and let it sit, I made profits earlier in the year even with the downturn after May, I learned a valuable lesson. Take profits when your gut tells you it's time and don't take everything out if you don't quite feel ready.

That's where I'm at now, I don't have that much in yet, but my stance will stay the same. At this stage whether it rains bears or bulls, I don't care either way because I'll be winning.

 Just DCA if you genuinely believe in something and if you are a bit scared atm, it's natural, set your price targets (what you're willing to lose/ win) and don't let anyone tell you different.

The bullet list is what I'm thinking… what do you guys think? How would you invest it?   


Once most of these games release, they prob will have another run up huh? Then they will all consolidate/rise long term based on what people actually enjoy playing.   


I’m looking at going all in SANDBOX or STAR ATLAS with $3k. Also, even though the narrative is around metaverse, what projects are actually looking to be used in VR? I know VRChat is another popular metaverse but isn’t on the blockchain to invest in.  


* **MANA / DECENTRALAND** \- The obvious leader in a decentralized metaverse, I’d say like the bitcoin equivalent.
* **SANDBOX** \- Prob a better play now for ROI, the ethereum equivalent. Brands buying virtual real estate here. It’s still only 2.6 billion in market cap compared to MANA’s 5 billion market cap. Lots of room to grow still yeah?
* **NTVRK** \- Just went through the dip a bit… You can buy space, land, ads, nfts, staking. Focus on virtual reality and augmented reality. They’re not just focused in the game side version of metaverse but the roadmap extends into virtual and augmented reality where the metaverse will start evolving into. MANA is only 2D.
* **CUBE** \- Metaverse that actually has VR capabilities.
* **WILDER WORLD** \- Graphics look dope. The price does seem extremely volatile. Not yet released.
* **STAR ATLAS** \- High budget looking space exploration game. Not yet released. Built on Solana… could have a nice run up.
* **GALA** \- They create blockchain games. Still only 7 cents. Price is moving slow.
* **ILLUVIUM** \- Built on the ethereum blockchain. Turned based game. Not yet released.
* **MVI** \- A metaverse index with a bunch of metaverse based projects. Seems like the safest investment. Slow and steady.
* **RNDR** \- Graphics engine built for the metaverse.
* **BLOK** \- Cyberpunk skyscraper. Still not released. Graphics look a bit meh… It’s highest was 16 cents and been on a downtrend since then.
* **REDFOX** \- Just went through a big dip so it has a good entry price right now. Possible potential for gains.
* **ENJ** \- Could be the safest long term play. Might not have the momentum for gains anymore though. Fundamentally it’ll be useful for centralized and decentralized games to create NFTS. Less niche and more longer play.
* **SHIRYO INU** \- Fantasy NFT trading card game. Super early entry. Fractions of a cent.
* **MERIT CIRCLE** \- Partnering with Illuvium, Star Atlas, and Axie Infinity. Seems like it could be vital for gaming and play to earn.
* **UFO** \- Fractions of a cent.. not yet super accessible to buy. Community owned.
* **VRA** \- Currently 7 cents, could hit 25 cents?
* **OVR** \- Mapping the real world virtually that you can scan the world with your phone.
* **METAHERO** \- Trending on Tiktok. Another thing that scans real world objects.
* **KALAO** \- Avalanches metaverse."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3934850|public|self|What's the next metaverse play with high ROI left in it?

Well where the hell else am I supposed to get the money, PayPal? And i can't even trade it off to my Coinbase or Crypto.com

Some of my mates DCA no matter what others only DCA when the crypto dear index is below 50. Right now I am tempted to buy but just cannot do it as it would increase my average buying price. Most people do not like the red but here I just love it and I am praying to God Almighty for the value to go lower so I can lower my average price.

Just to be careful i would take a loan small enough that even if all exchanges and every crypto went to 0 i wouldnt be in trouble (and the chance of this is close to 0)

And assuming i do it what stablecoins do you recommend (i assume not tether) and what platfroms? I have been thinking about binance, coinbase and crypto.com, as i dont see them disappearing, specially CDC after the deals they have made recently.

I really dont see the downside aside from how taking a loan looks scary.

Is it a known fact that Technical Analysis is a self fulfilling prophecy as opposed to a tool for modeling?  TA doesn’t predict price action, it causes the price action.  The more universally accepted a chart is, the more accurate it will end up being.  Correlation or causation.  I think it’s cause.  The chart that everyone is using says a crash will happen at X so a group of people who really believe this is accurate sell at X.  Then others follow them in selling because they are seeing the selling the chart said they’d see.  And there’s the dip.  Then the trash scared asses get shook out.  Then liquidations.  And you have a crash.  One caused by the chart, not predicted by it.  Same with support.  Breakouts.  Etc.

The exchanges would then give the liquidity earned to Tether to compensate for all the USDT they occasionally print so often. 

It would explain why USDT's backings isn't exactly 1:1. Should this be found out, all securities, trades and futures tied to Tether would crash tanking the market to lows you didn't think possible. It would be akin to 2008's housing sector collapse where debt from others was used as collateral(collateralized debt obligation)

I had a friend introduce me to crypto a few years ago but I was strapped for cashed and didn't have the money to gamble. He went all in at the time, he cashed out his 401k, everything in Bitcoin, and now he's in the Caribbean. He shared some investment advice, something like ""if you think one thing will grow faster than everything else, then don't diversify, just put all your eggs in the racecar"".

So I took a page from his book and sold all my stocks and my liquidity positions and put everything into eth. On November 11th when it was around $4700. Now I'm down 14% this week. Definitely not selling because I don't need the money and this ain't my first rodeo. I'm sure by next week/month/year I'll be all the better for it.

I listened to that voice and I’m praying it wasn’t some asshole hedgie ghost playing with my emotions.

I held. I hold. My portfolio is dying, but you only lose if you sell, right? Right? Right? 😂

Regardless, I’m proud of my coin choices. I did my own research, I bought projects with merit. I’ll keep DCAing through this dip, I just pray that’s what it is. 

Let this be a dip. Not crypto winter. I’ll hold either way, but damn would it be nice to have some money in the bank. Less credit card debt. More money to invest, and to enjoy some moments with my family.  

TL:DR 

It sucks right now for crypto. I’m praying for a bounce back. Either way, I’m not leaving. 

I’m working, nose to the grindstone. I’ll keep buying, even as it drops. I’ll DCA and believe in my choices. 

If you had enough conviction to buy a coin, have as much conviction to hold it through the storm. Add to your bag if you can. Not financial advice, but common frigging sense. 

Keep up the fight. I truly believe crypto is the future. However long it takes to blow up, I’ll use that time to build my stash. We are still very early. Most people know nothing of crypto. Imagine when the masses find out. Think of the money that pours in when adoption is widespread. If I’m wrong, tell me. I love a debate. But for me, wait it out. I’ll weather this storm for the gains I know I’ll see. Patience is 🔑 

Rant over. Thanks for listening. Don’t forget to tip your waitress. If you’re driving, don’t drink, and if you drink, don’t drive.

Their goal is to become the industry leading ZK powerhouse with their newly released Polygon Miden, an Ethereum-Compatible Rollup.  

This is the TL;DR: from their [announcement](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-announces-polygon-miden-a-stark-based-ethereum-compatible-rollup/):  

**Polygon Announces Polygon Miden**

&gt;We are excited to announce the newest member of the Polygon solution suite - Polygon Miden, an upcoming STARK-based, EVM-compatible rollup. The project is led by Bobbin Threadbare, former Facebook’s core ZK researcher who led the development of Winterfell. Today we are releasing Polygon Miden’s core component - Miden VM, the first open-source STARK-based VM. We will continue working and investing in this and other Polygon’s ZK-based efforts, with the ultimate goal of becoming the industry’s leading ZK powerhouse.  

Development is well underway and they've already released the 0.1 version of Miden VM, an early version aimed towards cutting edge developers, it'll also feature Multi-language support guaranteeing Ethereum-compatibility, one of the supported langauges will be The Move Language, a safe and reliable language developed for blockchains.  
  



**Privacy by design**

&gt;Even though Polygon Miden is first and foremost a scaling solution, we don’t want privacy to be an afterthought. We believe that privacy will become one of the most important topics in the industry once the pressing need for scaling is met to a satisfying extent, and we are planning and preparing for this.  

Polygon are implementing privacy which makes it possible to selectively reveal parts of a program while keeping the rest of the program private. Sounds very interesting to me.  

Polygon Miden is fully open-source, and the only fully open-source STARK-based scaling solution.  

Polygon are releasing new solutions constantly and they haven't even been around for very long, so far they've released:  

Polygon [PoS](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/getting-started/)  
Polygon [SDK](https://blog.polygon.technology/announcing-polygon-sdk-the-gateway-to-multi-chain-ethereum-8ad580ec387/)  
Polygon [Avail](https://blog.polygon.technology/introducing-avail-by-polygon-a-robust-general-purpose-scalable-data-availability-layer-98bc9814c048/)  
Polygon [Nightfall](https://blog.polygon.technology/ey-collaborates-with-polygon-to-co-develop-ethereum-scaling-solutions-and-enterprise-blockchains/)  
Polygon [Hermez](https://blog.polygon.technology/hermez-network-and-polygon-merge-becoming-polygon-hemrez/)  

And now Polygon [Miden](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-announces-polygon-miden-a-stark-based-ethereum-compatible-rollup/).  

 

TL;DR:  
Polygon keeps delivering on their promises, they are creating new solutions constantly, they are willing to pivot in order to stay competitive(shown by their commitment to ZK &amp; Privacy) and I think the token(in this market) is currently severely undervalued."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3934136|public|self|The way Polygon(MATIC) is moving right now (sideways or down) makes absolutely no sense|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qx4cqm/the_way_polygonmatic_is_moving_right_now_sideways/|all_ads|6|1637263755.0|UPDATE|0de51794-8fa8-11eb-8c8b-0e387731294b|PROJECT-UPDATE|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'pcd0GeKPGT0x3pAYVTELd0Ru5jKgESbjmeIUYQZB9M0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qLYuoc-x3oV159nXbZn9EP0wx9NUy5zOxaxlrgDIS4Q.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c0e82e127bc1474699bb38a54cb468b91fa94b1', 'width': 108}, {'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qLYuoc-x3oV159nXbZn9EP0wx9NUy5zOxaxlrgDIS4Q.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd0a46fc0eaede65d49ed932ed1e503066dbc89b', 'width': 216}, {'height': 160, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qLYuoc-x3oV159nXbZn9EP0wx9NUy5zOxaxlrgDIS4Q.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76d66634dfcc3a1c9df7d0e3b662723c35b163e4', 'width': 320}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qLYuoc-x3oV159nXbZn9EP0wx9NUy5zOxaxlrgDIS4Q.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c50187ef1b07ac8acb05c19759f1b87175655f26', 'width': 640}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qLYuoc-x3oV159nXbZn9EP0wx9NUy5zOxaxlrgDIS4Q.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caaf1d9e5fae1060b25bd18c7ad50c9c970c3af8', 'width': 960}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qLYuoc-x3oV159nXbZn9EP0wx9NUy5zOxaxlrgDIS4Q.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=022c002c3070ce267bd16b741175c92740b358bf', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 800, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/qLYuoc-x3oV159nXbZn9EP0wx9NUy5zOxaxlrgDIS4Q.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1ae7f26258343885a20be1698aadbeb67a74bc6f', 'width': 1600}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||2021-11-19 00:59:15+00:00|t3_qx4cqm|0|13|0.67||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||19_11_21|11_21|0.1058338|0.4481893|0.44597685|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.06887347251176834|0.13158805668354034|0.01260214764624834|0.5141336917877197|0.26247766613960266|0.010325027629733086

A question to ponder: Has Moon farming ""ruined this sub"" over the past year, or has it simply been the insane explosion of growth we've seen as new crypto people flock here looking for the latest meme pump? I'd wager that any sub on Reddit would see a drop in quality with hundreds of thousands of new users in search of a quick buck. What % of users have even opened their vault? How are Moons the main problem?

Picture your other hobby subreddits outside of crypto. How would people take advantage of a token mechanism to destroy the quality of the sub? Mostly, they wouldn't. r/Cryptocurrency is uniquely positioned to have spam, scams, moonshots, noobs and annoying posts and comments. If social tokens even \*sort of\* work here, they'll for sure work on the New York Giants sub where upvotes are earned through quality commentary on their favorite football team. Those users would be rewarded with a token that could be used to buy tickets, merch, meet-the-team opportunities, or whatever. Apply this concept to your favorite band, sports team, artist, etc.

If you're down on Moons and social tokens as a concept, I'd invite you to listen to any number of recent podcasts featuring Raoul Pal where he talks a lot about how bullish he is on social tokens. The July episode of The Defiant podcast with Raoul as a guest would be a good one. Even if it's imperfect (especially at first), users owning pieces of the communities they're passionate about is worlds better than what we have now. We have to think bigger about what's possible, especially here on Reddit where an NFT platform is being built which you gotta think could be interoperable with community tokens in the future. 

Anyways--just wanna invite everyone to be excited and bullish about social tokens. I believe they'll be one of the next big things in the crypto space and think it's cool that Moons are among the first iterations of what will one day be the norm for online community involvement. 

May we all end up on the moon one way or another.

# Nobody knows sh*t about f**k!

Ok, feels much better now. So what's your panic sell story? How much convinced you were when you panic sold? Was it worth it? Or you fell for a astrologer too? 

I hope we could give some of our experiences to the newbies and help each other cope with the dip. One thing that is certain in crypto space is that blue chips always goes back up. Other than that Holding is not a bad idea if you invest in a solid project and are in it for long term. Many projects has shown astronomical returns after a crash or dip.

Some of it is pretty funny, but a lot of it is intrinsically linked with rising political disdain of cryptocurrencies. A ton of political commentators regularly follow and comment on their tweets and the account has 250k followers. I’ve seen other accounts too with similar themes. 

Given that we’ve seen many attacks on cryptocurrencies this year through legislation, this trend worries me. If the public starts viewing the entire community as an NFT money laundering, pump-dump scheme filled industry, we’re going to start facing calls for heavy regulation. I kind of agree that a lot of the NFT art / apes stuff is stupid and probably the least valuable use case for NFT technology, but we can’t let that stuff define our community. There’s a lot of great stuff in blockchain, and not everyone is in here for the 100x gains. The technology is revolutionary, and adoption comes with people viewing it favorably, not as a scam.

Micropee is powered by Metaplay and requires your funds to grow. Each dollar invested prevents Micropee from feeling ashamed of the size of its $pee and allows Micropee's wallet to do the talking.
Micropee needs your help to stop the daily burn, so please invest and grow this little $pee so that we can arrive at the token amount of 100, 000,000 $pee.

I’ve used OKCoin for awhile. Sent a lot of people to them from Reddit for the ability to withdraw on Matic and avax. Benefited from simple promos on near and avax. Everything was going well, they seemed legit. 

But now I’m pissed off.  I did the 100HODL promo where if you set up a recurring buy for 6 months, you get $70. In the rules it says if your purchase gets turned off, you have 30 days to turn it back on.  

Their app was super shitty early this year.  In one of their app updates, my recurring buy got deleted.  I turned it right back on, realized it set the next purchase for a full month later (this couldn’t be modified, app was shit) so I also did an insta buy of same amount to have a buy each month. 

I followed the letter of the rules by turning my buy back on within 30 days, added the extra buy to meet “spirit” of the rules.  

Bonus was due in mid October, not paid. I logged a support case, they assured me it’d be paid but they had a backlog. 

Half dozen such emails over a month, then today I get told they decided I don’t qualify and they’d rather lose a customer than give me $70. The rep even had the balls to suggest I refer more people to get $50 that way. 

So yeah, I won’t be adding any more funds here. I’ll move everything off as soon as my staking times expire.  

I’ve posted a bunch of comments recommending OKCoin for ability to withdrawal directly on polygon and Avalanche… as such, I feel it’s necessary to share this as well."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3934164|public|self|Be wary of OKCoin on longer promotions.

Just started investing in Crypto and what looking a bit into the Ledger Nano S but don't know enough to make an educated decision on buying one or not? 

Could anyone explain/offer any informative/trustworthy videos on the topic.

Also if possible, are there any alternatives to this piece of hardware or is Ledger basically the best offered cold storage. Would the X be better if only investing small amounts, or should I stick to the S as I am very new to investing in Cryptocurrency and investing in general.

Any help would be greatly appreciated and any advice/informative videos/articles would be very helpful to me, as again, I am new to this.

There can only be 21 of them and you need to stake possible ten million USD worth of bsc to be one.

We talk a lot about front running transactions. As a validator if you see a bunch of buy transaction coming in for wrapped eth for example on a Dex... You can create a transaction to buy a bunch of the same crypto at the beginning of the block before them. Then put a transaction at the end to sell. You just scalped all their dex swaps.

Seeing how binance just invested 1 billion into developing bnb more... And the CEO is supposedly very very rich (at least tens of billions)... Is it possible their whole ecosystem is rigged to an extent? 

I created tokens on BSC for pancakeswap and that whole ecosystem is kind of a cesspool. And the more I think about it the more I'm convinced BSC is scalping us hard on a lot of these trades. Its not great that bnb has the 3rd biggest mcap and it's probably going to continue to grow with the 1B infusion.

I'd really caution everyone to stick to polygon and other layer2s. Trading shitcoins on bnb legitimately hurts crypto and eventually the whole thing could come crashing down if binance ever gets hounded by regulators. They literally have BSC setup so they aren't liable for the network but can scalp every tx.

*Quote:*  ""One more area that I hope nation-states start paying greater attention to is the rise of cryptocurrencies – because what looks like a very interesting and somewhat exotic effort to literally mine new coins in order to trade with them has the potential for undermining currencies, for undermining the role of the dollar as the reserve currency, **for destabilizing nations**, perhaps starting with small ones but going much larger."" 

[Source of the Quote.](https://thecryptobasic.com/2021/11/19/hillary-clinton-says-crypto-could-devastate-many-country-economies-and-undermine-dollar-as-worlds-reserve-currency/)

[Video of the Interview.](https://twitter.com/i/status/1461677237091115008)

What does this mean, at least from my point of view. This it's just proof that crypto, it's putting the Fiat system to the test, and it's making noise to the people who have a huge stake at the current status quo of the financial structure that societies have been under, over decades now.

And why is that? Why does crypto, and in my opinion specially Bitcoin, can disrupt so abruptly. It's mainly for the 5 services that money needs to provide to society in order to exist, and work for us as a medium of exchange.

What are those 5 services that something has to have in order to become a currency?

1.- Divisibility: Money needs to be divisible, it's a pretty obvious one, if you wan't to buy something expensive you won be carrying 2 trucks full of coins with you, you can just make bigger measures of money or smaller ones for cheap things like a can of soda.

2.- Durability: It needs to be stand the proof of time, and I'm not talking about the agreement on a certain Fiat currency such as USD or EUR, I mean, if you store 5 apples in a bank they're going to be worth nothing in a few days (if you use apples for exchanging goods), but if you put coins, paper, or gold it will be there for a long, long time.

3.- Recognizability: Each trading party can verify the authenticity of the money. Meaning that every transaction that I'm giving you money, you can be secure if it is real, by putting in into that light that reflects certain materials that they put into money, if it would be gold there are other ways to verify if it's real.

4.- Portability: Pretty obvious one, you must be able to move it across time and space without problem.

5.- Scarcity: This is the most important thing about money, and one of the best ways that crypto it's better than Fiat money ruled by Goverments. Scarcity occurs when the demand outstrips supply, so when there is a demand of a certain currency there will be a supply of that currency.

Crypto, just makes the checkmark over these 5 services, and specially Scarcity. Why? Governments and the people who control the flow of currencies, **ALWAYS** takes advantage of the position where they are in, and just print more of that currency in order to have more for them, and less for everybody else, this is just human nature, and you can study a little bit of history and you will notice that this repeats over time on every society. 

In the case of Bitcoin, we just have supply of 21,000,000 coins, and no one can make more out of tin air like governments do, when they please. So Scarcity, it's the main advantage that crypto and bitcoin has over Fiat currencies.

So if you ask me, for the reasons that I just gave, Hillary Clinton, just point out the fact that Crypto, it's making the work that we all expect it to be making over time, and it's doing it fast.

Ps: This post was remake by myself, last one got deleted, for having no source.

Also, In no shape or form this is a political attack on Hillary, it's just a perspective and speculation around the main reason on why Crypto was created."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3939276|public|self|Hillary Clinton declaration, might just mark the second leg of this bull run.|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qxmi8h/hillary_clinton_declaration_might_just_mark_the/|all_ads|6|1637327107.0|SPECULATION|ebb30328-94d1-11eb-94d6-0e7d4f551e2d|SPECULATION|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'm4tWD6wt6lYVpWgjm9E0mfnzAdPBAjRn_5pT-TFhO1E', 'resolutions': [{'height': 137, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZVm8OMX58Dx2bL2EsV_TKj_u1Z1DSzp25vNPgBW-2yo.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28cd3d61d467c3188501b9196dfedddd6bf987ec', 'width': 108}, {'height': 274, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZVm8OMX58Dx2bL2EsV_TKj_u1Z1DSzp25vNPgBW-2yo.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=512c418cc5832658e7e3f5431d43141ae6eeba66', 'width': 216}, {'height': 406, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZVm8OMX58Dx2bL2EsV_TKj_u1Z1DSzp25vNPgBW-2yo.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca9de6c6335c2d2448587692bf7ddcde5d2e819e', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 429, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZVm8OMX58Dx2bL2EsV_TKj_u1Z1DSzp25vNPgBW-2yo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=94d00b18ed781a47a3e280197f7ada3bad31d654', 'width': 338}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||2021-11-19 18:35:07+00:00|t3_qxmi8h|0|140|0.88||1||[]|False|True|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||19_11_21|11_21|0.08798095|0.4706187|0.44140035|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.05708480626344681|0.21451924741268158|0.014078743755817413|0.21398550271987915|0.4815766215324402|0.01875513233244419

I'm looking for the platform with the highest apr for whatever stablecoin: it could be USDT, USDC, BUSD, UST etc.
I prefer platforms where you don't have to invest in a collateral. 
For now I prefer not to consider DeFi platforms where you have to invest in a couple of coins.
Up to now,, I think the first one is terrastation, it gives 19,5% on UST but you have to buy LUNA and then exchange in UST, the second one is crypto.com Earn where it gives up to 14% but you have to invest a lot of money and block it for 3 months.

I personally don't use Crypto.com but I see it as a really good starting point for new investors.

My question, do you guys think Vegas is a good place to advertise for new investors or do you think it could potentially give a bad name to crypto by having people associate it with gambling?

Personally I think any advertising is good advertising as long as they don't target specific meme coins, but I am curious what everyone else thinks."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3939474|public|self|Crypto.com advertising in Vegas in many spots.|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qxn60e/cryptocom_advertising_in_vegas_in_many_spots/|all_ads|6|1637329031.0|DEBATE|5b762856-d7c9-11e4-822a-22000b2300b2|DEBATE|||||||||||2021-11-19 19:07:11+00:00|t3_qxn60e|0|44|0.91||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||19_11_21|11_21|0.11076456|0.4499968|0.43923864|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07071885466575623|0.20293867588043213|0.01466779038310051|0.2337827980518341|0.4597536027431488|0.018138350918889046

I figured, hey why not. They seem to have every coin available, apparently the most ""up-to-date"" pricing for every crypto (which mystifies me still because every exchange claims this same thing), and were promising ""0% fees for the first 30 days"". Well that all sounded good enough for me to join up. So I did. I wired some money in, no problems there. I bought some coin, no problems there. No fees apparently either. Then it dawned on me that they don't have a ""limit"" option and they force you to pay ""market"" prices. Well technically that's any price they want you to pay, not actually market pricing. Either way, I was going to let my money sit in over night on a play that I thought might net me 10% and sell in the morning. I woke up, 10% was more like 7% and I opted to sell either way. Well lo and behold I go to cash out about $300, or so I thought, and all of a sudden I'm only able to net $43. I look at why that is and even though the price of the coin was actively at $3.52, I was being forced to sell at $3.36 which basically eliminated all of my profit. Oh and the little sell screen that came up made sure to mention that there were ""0 fees"" on this transaction. So there you have it, real time price manipulation to steal your money. I'd rather pay a fee and know the fee going into it, but this is a sneaky way of taking money from people by telling them that they're selling at prices that aren't actually based in reality. They're selling your coins at prices that net them profit and leave you with....next to nothing. Avoid [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) \- they're garbage. Oh also their mobile app is garbage because it's actively trying to sync market data from over 1500 coins which is the stupidest thing you could try and cram into a mobile app."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3939611|public|self|Crypto.com is garbage - recent experience|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qxnp2h/cryptocom_is_garbage_recent_experience/|all_ads|6|1637330577.0|DISCUSSION||DISCUSSION|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'CRCsePS2U5hRdpWnGOUwszx1WMeeHS503nZw_a5UK-8', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h4CRA-D8mOjch58T5aIXlIKJfR6cE-h7W5rQml1uVuU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a2bfd99c71705498a15d5a7d9f464e771c5f458', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h4CRA-D8mOjch58T5aIXlIKJfR6cE-h7W5rQml1uVuU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b35c038e37ba9b0b86ceb453fb198d074c23437f', 'width': 216}, {'height': 167, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h4CRA-D8mOjch58T5aIXlIKJfR6cE-h7W5rQml1uVuU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a748c38b9385d201aad3b7988055cacc20eafd87', 'width': 320}, {'height': 335, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h4CRA-D8mOjch58T5aIXlIKJfR6cE-h7W5rQml1uVuU.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c64cb4a20c574df26a87e92e28472e2fcb39b96', 'width': 640}, {'height': 502, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h4CRA-D8mOjch58T5aIXlIKJfR6cE-h7W5rQml1uVuU.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc4f1940aa85d5526cc1f5afed4b31b7a0ed6ccd', 'width': 960}, {'height': 565, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h4CRA-D8mOjch58T5aIXlIKJfR6cE-h7W5rQml1uVuU.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59c6af39e811baac00a6f91eb0a27946780e2b1', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1309, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/h4CRA-D8mOjch58T5aIXlIKJfR6cE-h7W5rQml1uVuU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1fee0c77cf11fc65eee9c7c33839daf5f9c94923', 'width': 2500}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||2021-11-19 19:32:57+00:00|t3_qxnp2h|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||19_11_21|11_21|0.11076456|0.4499968|0.43923864|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07071885466575623|0.20293867588043213|0.01466779038310051|0.2337827980518341|0.4597536027431488|0.018138350918889046

So I'm closely following crypto since the early beginning - i work in crypto, but have a few questions which really bug me. How the hell do influencers target the people who have no idea of bitcoin?

I personally have many social media accounts, using Instagram I'm certain Facebook has my cookies as well even if i try to delete them. Using Google 90% of the time for my daily, multiple hour long research, I can assume that basically every tech giant knows that I would be a perfect target for crypto advertisment.
To confirm that: yes, i do get targeted Ads from various serious exchanges (where I am already registered, because I use many different exchanges) but here comes the twist of my observation: 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY SCAMMY ADS OR INFLUENCERS SHOVING THEIR SHILLS IN MY FACE.
Only the most legit projects, and exchanges as legit as it can get. The only Ad i've ever seen that i think should be illegal is a HitBTC Ad, since they really do shady stuff.

I get Ads for seriously new project with very good technical whitepapers, ads from the imho best exchanges, ads for crowdloans.
But i still read multiple times a day that people are getting shilled by influencers, buy into scam projects due to ads or get scammed somehow else which really hurts us all by damaging the reputation.
Beeing the *crypto-oracle* in my extended circle of friends and family I'm getting at least one call per week where somebody almost fell for a scam or already lost a chunk of money and then ask for help. If I can't protect my people neither can you and this needs to change.

I'm asking everyone a lot of questions to pin down how they made contact with the scam.
I'm not talking about hacks (e.g. someone saving 2$ on a windows 10 key by using a software cracker and getting drained as a result), just plain old scams.

About 80% of my friends/family who ever lost money claim that they found out about the hack via advertisement. Insta, Facebook, YouTube, GoogleAds. Either paid Shills or Advisement. (Most of them also never heard about reddit, although many scammers are here)

So, why am I NOT getting this Advertisment? I should clearly get these because I'm the absolute perfect crypto enthusiast, just like many of you fellow redditors.

I bet the scammers somehow are targeting people who know others that made money with crypto but know nothing about crypto themselves with social media ads.
Is this possible? Is this acceptable?
No wonder a customer on a social media platform can be worth big bucks. I honestly feel sad.


So, if you ever lost money on a scam, how did you find out about the scam?
Are you seeing scam ads?
Are shills getting shoved in your face?
Lets dig a little deeper together, because the system seems to be against the people, yet again."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3939564|public|self|Crypto, Social Media and the State of Advertisment|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qxnia9/crypto_social_media_and_the_state_of_advertisment/|all_ads|6|1637330034.0|DISCUSSION|87049662-0882-11e5-82e1-0e9d1a9f7761|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-11-19 19:23:54+00:00|t3_qxnia9|0|6|0.8||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||19_11_21|11_21|0.11076456|0.4499968|0.43923864|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07071885466575623|0.20293867588043213|0.01466779038310051|0.2337827980518341|0.4597536027431488|0.018138350918889046

DeFi – or decentralized finance – is a sector of the cryptocurrency industry that takes traditional financial services like loans and insurance and puts them on the blockchain. The main difference being, the decentralized financial applications these services run on are not controlled or maintained by any single company. Instead, they are managed completely by their own communities of users and through automatically executing computer programs known as “smart contracts.”

DeFi staking is a great way of generating an annual return on your deposited assets if you only plan on buying cryptocurrencies and holding them. The process is similar in nature to depositing money into a savings bank account except instead of earning less than 1% interest, you can typically earn anywhere between 5%-25% and in some cases, higher.

It is worth noting, however, that not all cryptocurrencies can be staked. There are also some other risks to be aware of when dealing with DeFi platforms. These include:

* DeFi platforms are not regulated. This means there are no consumer protections in place in the event you lose your capital from theft or fraud.
* A number of DeFi platforms have not had their computer code audited by a third party to ensure there aren’t any bugs or exploitable flaws. This leaves the platforms vulnerable to hacks and exploits. So far in 2021, $361 million has already been stolen from DeFi applications.

It’s recommended anyone looking to lock away funds in a DeFi staking application should perform his or her own rigorous due diligence beforehand.

Hope that helps, cheers."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3940137|public|self|What Is DeFi Staking ?

The cynic in me can't help but think that they are scared of losing control of people's money.

The main culprits in my case were Nexo and Celsius transactions which I've been using for a while to get a better return on my non-emergency savings.

I could understand if this was the first time I've used them, but I've been DCAing fiat across every payday for the past 4/5 months.

Are they genuinely concerned for people's money, or am I correct in my theory that they are making it difficult for people for more nefarious reasons?

Just noticed it when I checked on the CoinBase App

$3 of Enzyme up for grabs for answering 3 questions

Enjoy !

:)

Just load up the CoinBase app, click on the top left for Learn and Earn and click on Enzyme

Doesn't matter if you get any of the answers wrong, it lets you keep trying until you get the right answer

Hopefully this is enough words for the minimum posting requirement

Have a great weekend everyone

:)

But there are no negativ feeling, no panic or urge to sell. Its like crypto is doing its thing again, it will calm down eventually.
It was the same in the late spring dip.
I just dont care right now. Ill keep dca-ing, ill keep looking for the next thing, but i have so much faith into crypto, dips dont scare me at all.

Over the last 9 months they've had an average of 200-350 daily active users.

For a game that's worth $8bn it's MASSIVELY overvalued.

Only this week has their userbase increased to over 1k but I don't see that being sustained due to how expensive Land sales are - which are at a very low volume btw.

You can see the active user data yourself here:


https://catalyst-monitor.vercel.app/


Compare this to a game like VRChat who's got 1m daily active users. VRChat is only worth about $1-2bn based on their last funding round.

There's no logical reason that a metaverse game with only 0.1% of the userbase of VRChat is worth 4x more than it.

At present, algorithmic traders account for a large part of the transaction.

I saw a few months back something interesting about the app Crypto.com. Specifically the benefits of the ruby card. The one with 2% cash back, and 100% spotify. What do you think about it? It asks for 350€ in CRO for 6 months in order to get the benefits. Do you think is it worth the risk? I mean.. after the 6 months I can take the money back and most probably I will invest in something else. I want to specify the fact that the coin was constantly increasing in the last 2-3 months. It’s not much compared to others.. but still. I’m pretty new here and in this domain and would really appreciate some guidance.

I stayed out of crypto for the most part (Have a little BTC and ETH) for the past couple months as I did extensive research into all facets of the market, but I recently noticed that it’s probably time to start becoming a big player so I decided to jump onto what seems like a up-and-coming long term player in crypto.com.

My question is what do you guys think of crypto.com’s recent huge ventures into trying to make themselves big players in this market? Is it real? Also their own coin? If you believe crypto.com is going to be a big player from here on out (I do), you also have to believe that CRO is going to be a very safe and steady uptrend over the near future. Am I crazy for thinking this is a no-brainer to put some big money in there when I feel comfortable entering here soon?"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3939548|public|self|Just started putting large sums into crypto and have a couple questions…|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qxnglb/just_started_putting_large_sums_into_crypto_and/|all_ads|6|1637329901.0|DISCUSSION|87049662-0882-11e5-82e1-0e9d1a9f7761|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-11-19 19:21:41+00:00|t3_qxnglb|0|1|1.0||0||[]|True|False|[]||new||[]||False|False||||||||CHAT|||||||19_11_21|11_21|0.12832753|0.4872703|0.384402|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.08182957768440247|0.21628962457180023|0.014073725789785385|0.42507535219192505|0.242714986205101|0.020016731694340706

I guess I might as well spill the ""secret"" since it doesn't work. Instead of triangular arbitrage, which is the most that'll be effective for FOREX, the huge number of altcoins on Kraken allows for higher-order arbitrages to be effective. 

Originally I was using limit orders for the lower fee, but they often don't fill, so I tried switching to market orders just to see what would happen. And I noticed that it doesn't work because slippage is *always* coming out in the wrong direction. Like *every single trade*, and I just tried it several times. 

My bot is fast, doing all the processing in something like 0.5-2 milliseconds, and my ping to the server is 14-20 ms. 

Am I right in assuming that my idea isn't so secret after all, and people have already moved ""next door"" to Kraken's servers with uber-optimized setups to run this even faster? I didn't think it would be so competitive with the stock market being much bigger and more established in comparison."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|655320|public|self|How competitive is HFT on Kraken?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/qxg9fd/how_competitive_is_hft_on_kraken/|all_ads|6|1637308886.0|strategy|129cf0fa-a5d5-11e3-afb6-12313d003dd1||||||||||||2021-11-19 13:31:26+00:00|t3_qxg9fd|0|2|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||19_11_21|11_21|0.08798095|0.4706187|0.44140035|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.05708480626344681|0.21451924741268158|0.014078743755817413|0.21398550271987915|0.4815766215324402|0.01875513233244419

We all need to educate the newbies , so they don't get trapped into these shitty coins or maybe leave crypto all together ! , which they'd become future no-coiners who try to hinder others from getting in by their negative views , in that regard , I always try to suggest at least my friends that are into crypto to focus on what the general atmosphere is revolving around in that timeline and trade accordingly to that , one current hype is as an instance the metaverse hype , the next might be creative solutions to trade/exchange/rent of properties , cars and realestates in a decentralized blockchain-based manner which projects like [futurent](https://futurent.io/) might finally make this hollygrail possible !

Some of you might already knew about Greyscale or Kucoin shorting Doge in May and causing it's price to drop, or Elon Musk suddenly causing BTC to crash(and Dogecoin with it), but it was only the begining. Now they want new coin that they market as ""one that will bonk Doge"" to create meltdown in the crypto market and spark the need for regulations.

Here's some of that involvement illustrated here: [https://i.imgur.com/IYS33Yu.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IYS33Yu.jpg)

There's no way all these people decided to just get into some coin out of nowhere without big plan for it. There are even ""mysterious donors"" in their community that literally buy billboard ads in NY (see: [https://i.imgur.com/1Uzc5MG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1Uzc5MG.jpg)) and there's more and more coming in Australia, Germany, even in London or freaking Dubai, this isn't organic!

Their token will be used to regulate financial transactions between customers and freelancers. Investors and token holders can earn on staking. Plus, there are some ways to earn on token sale or pre-sale. (Waiting list registration started at - [https://token.wono.io/](https://token.wono.io/)).

They promise to post a series of articles, explaining the work of token and how to earn on it.   
So, here's why invest in Wono:   
   1) Idea. The token will be used as a payment between employers and freelancers. It's based on smart-contracts and aims to avoid fraud and scam in freelancing. Just to add, in 2021, out of 3.6 billion people's global workforce, 1.1 are [freelancers](https://www.ccn.com/38-of-freelancers-regularly-use-cryptocurrency-survey-reveals/). I guess, you see the potential.   
   2) [**Huobi**](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/) **support**. The project is supported by Huobi exchange. It's the third cryptocurrency exchange in the world after [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). All users would be able to stake and exchange tokens on Huobi via a special crypto-wallet.    
   3) Fast-growing [community](https://www.facebook.com/wonoworld/). For now, Wono.io is a freelance exchange for people mostly from Asia and Africa. It already has 518,000+ registered users from which 8,000+ are already paying for the subscription services. The Wono monthly turnover is $127,520. Average profit from one paying user: $15,94.  
   Of course, it's up to you to decide whether to invest in the Wono project or not, but you can see its advantages and potential.

During this run, I'm focused on growing my BTC, so I'm looking for a lending platform with a better user experience and higher interest rates. I've searched about many platforms but I need to hear about real experiences.

Also, I want to know that, Is there any platforms that you be able to get your interest in any other assets?

For example, I deposit BTC but I want to get my interest to be paid in ETH.
