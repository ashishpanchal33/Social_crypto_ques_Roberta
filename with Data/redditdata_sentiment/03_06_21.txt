My rules included strong DD, long-term potential, past history of performance, buy and hold for a 20% gain (news-dependent, too) or set stop losses at 8%. This way I could have 2 ""losers"" and one winner and still be up 4%. I did poorly, not because my rules sucked, but because I had no discipline. I would get emotionally invested, hold past -8%, try to squeeze out a 22% gain, etc. BIG MONEY would come in and do whatever they wanted with a stock price.  Shake out the weak hands, scoop up my shares at a discount, and I'd be just sitting here licking my wounds.  ""This is fine.""

Now here comes crypto and most traditional stock advice goes out the window. THIS WAS REFRESHING since I couldn't hack it with regular stock trading. BUY and HODL is the mantra, and to me, this is something I know I can do.  So, I've got a little cheat sheet for myself, and this is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor, its just where I am right now with crypto. Maybe you are, too.

**Basic Rules I'm Following:**

1. **Only spend what you're okay with potentially losing.** Of course, I don't want to lose any money, but a few hundred bucks per month...I can live with that with my current income.

2. **Buy real coins with real potential.**  Just like stocks, I want solid potential. ADA, ETH, VET, ALGO, etc. all are either currently working and doing what they were meant to or are well on their way. S*** coins are called that for a reason...and I'm not willing to ""play"" in that arena.

3.  **Stick with coins that have a max supply.**  Inflation-killer. America prints fiat, fiat becomes less valuable. It's just logic. Sure, you can make money with unlimited supply coins. People got rich of one of those recently. I can't hack it and I know it. I know my limits.

4.  **Stay emotionally unattached!**  I look at this as like a fancy savings account.  I never got emotional when my savings account earned 0.0000002% per year. Hence, I no longer have a savings account of any significance (3 months salary, just in case). Crypto is my store of value. 

5. **Hold.**  I've heard many on here say they are holding until it becomes life-changing or it all goes away. I love that attitude. I'm in a long trade here, 8+ years I'm thinking, DCA-ing along the way.

So, don't let these billionaires with their ""statements"" and ""tweets"" impact your decisions. Don't let their attempts at price manipulation shake you.  If you bought this year and you're still hodling, you just survived a HUGE dip/correction/loss/etc. I think it was one of the biggest drops in history for some coins(?).  Where are you now? Up. 75% of my hodlings are back in the green.  We're all back up.  And now YOU are a ""survivor"" and got the battle scars to prove it.

Blockchain networks will reduce fees, bring more transparency to the murky world of big finance and dramatically reduce the transfer time for sending money around the world.

In this post, our own Sam Klemens explores what blockchain is, how blockchain in banking will work, and a few of the key advantages that blockchains offer versus the existing financial system.

# How Blockchain Works

A blockchain is a decentralized network that typically has several qualities:

* Anyone can use the network without having to acquire special permission
* Most blockchain networks are transparent
* Good blockchain networks are immutable, which means that data and transactions cannot be altered
* Blockchains are secured via community participation rather than via a centralized server

It can be helpful to compare and contrast a blockchain network with a database. Only certain permissioned users can access the information stored on a database. A database is centralized in one location and secured by a single company or organization. Authorized users can easily alter information that’s stored on a database. 

Blockchains have many different use cases:

* Blockchain banking is popular right now with [DeFi on the Ethereum network](https://www.exodus.io/blog/tag/decentralized-finance-defi). Users can lend, borrow and exchange assets on decentralized platforms that a centralized company doesn’t control
* Blockchains can be used to send value, as is the case with Bitcoin and other monetary blockchains like Litecoin or Nano
* When considering blockchain financial services, most blockchain currencies have a limit on the number of coins that can be created. This makes them suitable as inflation hedges (there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin)
* Anyone can use a blockchain to timestamp data. Blockchains are fantastic for timestamping because they cannot be modified
* Blockchains will eventually make a majority of accounting and back-office jobs redundant, although this could take ten or fifteen years

One downside of blockchains is that they’re not very good at storing data. If a blockchain financial services firm needs to store significant amounts of data, a database is much more suitable. However, some blockchain projects (such as Bluzelle, SIA, and Filecoin) have been built to address this.

Another downside is that many public blockchains have scaling problems. Most blockchain banking networks are not currently fast enough to support the type of traffic that PayPal can process.

**Private blockchains**

A private blockchain is a network that’s controlled by one company or a consortium of companies. [R3](https://www.r3.com/) is one of the most well-known private blockchains, and it’s [been around since](https://www.r3.com/history/) 2014. For blockchain in banking, JP Morgan also has a private blockchain that their [JPM stablecoin](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/news/digital-coin-payments) is built on. Only institutional JP Morgan clients can use the JPM coin.

A private blockchain’s key disadvantage is that it’s a closed-off system that only a select group of people can access. Private blockchain financial services solutions lack the interoperability of a network like Ethereum.

The major advantage of private blockchain banking is that these networks can scale to thousands of transactions per second. Private blockchain networks are usually faster than public blockchain networks because they sacrifice security and inclusivity for speed and efficiency.

If private blockchain financial services are faster, does that mean they’ll be the most adopted solution?

It’s unlikely that this will be the case. Public blockchains have such a large network effect that it makes a lot more sense to build on them, versus a private blockchain. The consulting firm EY has spent several million dollars [building out infrastructure](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjessel/2020/01/06/ernst--young-doubles-down-on-their-bet-with-ethereum/?sh=52649b7348b1) on top of Ethereum because they believe that businesses will use public blockchains in the future.

Furthermore, there’s a lot of work being done to scale public blockchains so that they can handle enough transactions to make them commercially viable.

# How Blockchain Financial Services will Change the World

There are quite a few ways that blockchain in banking is going to change the legacy financial system. Here are a few of the best examples:

**Faster &amp; Cheaper Remittance**

Multinational corporations are going to be one of the largest beneficiaries of blockchain financial services. Corporations can use blockchain based stablecoins to send millions or billions of dollars to anywhere in the world for a negligible fee.

International money transfers with the existing financial system can take days or even a week or more, depending on the location. Blockchain banking will be an exponential improvement over this outdated system.

**Smart Contracts to Take Over the Accounting Department**

Software is eating the world, and blockchain financial services are just the latest example of this phenomenon. Financial smart contracts are going to revolutionize the accounting industry. Here are a few of the services that smart contracts can offer. 

* Automatic payments to a distributor once the merchandise is received
* Automatic tax payments
* A more efficient accounting ledger for a business
* Automatic currency exchange between stablecoins

While it’s not a positive sign for employment, the stark truth is that smart contracts are going to make millions of jobs redundant. Blockchain banking contracts will replace many accountants, back-office staff, and lawyers.

The employment situation is bad news, but the good news is that smart contracts will lower the costs for businesses all over the world. Some percentage of that saving will be passed on to consumers.

**Offering Blockchain Financial Services to Customers**

DeFi, which stands for Decentralized Finance, has become an extremely popular part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. DeFi users can borrow money, deposit money to earn interest or exchange their assets on decentralized exchanges. All of this is groundbreaking technology and the amount of money that’s locked up in DeFi has been [growing exponentially](https://defipulse.com/) since 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k0n40eijy2371.png?width=1798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8771d25a2ac7afeaf7ac53b79ddb3c09f29f9011

The problem is that decentralized applications are not so easy to use. To use DeFi you have to know how to set up a crypto wallet, send money to different addresses, and interface with blockchain apps that are not always intuitive.

The legacy financial system could benefit from DeFi by creating a more user-friendly interface for some of these decentralized applications. A bank could connect to a DeFi protocol on the backend and then allow their customers to access that application right through their banking website.

The bank would benefit by taking a small fee for this service, and customers would benefit because they could access decentralized protocols without needing a deep understanding of blockchain technology.

**Who Will Benefit the Most from Blockchain Banking?**

The cool thing about blockchain technology in banking is that everyone is going to benefit from it. Blockchain is like the internet, it’s a universally beneficial technology.

Large corporations will send money all over the world for only a fraction of what it costs today. People who save money can deposit it with DeFi applications to earn a real interest rate, not the 0% rate that’s common for most bank accounts.

Banks that adopt blockchain will be able to offer sophisticated financial products to their customers. These forward-looking banks can charge for the service and also grow their customer base.

Who will get hurt? Businesses and banks that don’t adopt blockchain. They will become uncompetitive compared to their rivals who keep up with the latest technology.

# The Advantages of Blockchain

Here are a few more advantages of blockchain financial services that we haven’t covered yet.

**Micropayments**

Certain blockchain networks make it financially feasible to send micropayments as small as just ten or twenty cents. Granted, this is not possible with every network. For example, on Bitcoin, the typical fee is a few dollars. However, on other networks, the fees are so small that micropayments are a possibility.

**Full Financial Access**

Anyone in the world can access financial services that are built on the blockchain. All you need is a way to get a bit of crypto, and then you can participate in these ecosystems.

Blockchain banking is much more inclusive than the traditional banking system, which shuts billions of people out because they don’t have the right documents.

**Bitcoin is an Independent Currency**

Out of all the blockchains, Bitcoin is the most secure. Bitcoin is not controlled by any state, organization or company. It’s a currency outside of the jurisdiction of nation states.

Bitcoin’s supply cannot be inflated, and governments cannot take Bitcoin from people who are holding it. This makes Bitcoin an elegant solution for citizens living under repressive regimes.

# The Future is Blockchain Banking

Blockchain banking is the way of the future. Building a financial system on top of the blockchain offers so many benefits that there’s no way the legacy system is going to survive.

It might take a decade or two to transition fully to blockchain, but the process has already started. We’re currently experiencing mass Bitcoin adoption, DeFi is taking off, and multiple countries are talking about creating their own Central Bank Digital Currencies. The future of financial services is coming, and it’s coming fast.

You’ve got to say yes to opportunities when they are presented and be okay with possible failure. Most importantly though, don’t settle once you get a taste of success.

You watch a few videos and take a quiz or just google the answers and take the quiz straight away like most people do.

Anyway, as I was taking the new PPAY one it got me thinking - Coinmarketcap already has your email and kinda knows how many of which coins you hold (given that you actually keep track of your portfolio there). The quiz also gives you your Binance ID (which is linked to your actual ID) and ETH wallet address. All this data about you would be next to impossible to connect otherwise, and they suddenly have it all in one place. And you gave that all away for a promise of a few $ worth of a potential shitcoin...

Only time will tell what Coinmarketcap will do with all that info on you. Share it with your local tax inspector? ""Leak"" (sell) it to the dark web? Or probably nothing.

If it smells fishy to you too, these are the precautions you can take just in case: 

\- if you're planning to use a blockchain (ETH) address for a secret stash – don't let it be traced to your ID: avoid direct transactions from any KYC (Know Your Customer) Centralized Exchange (CEX) to it, and certainly don't expose it for giveaways along with your email or other personal info;

\- use different emails for registering on each CEX and another separate one for portfolio trackers (such as CMC), giveaways and airdrops;

\- the only missing piece of the puzzle is your phone number – keep it safe and never reveal the phone number you used to create a CEX account anywhere crypto-related;

\- enable authenticator 2FA, not SMS.

It's probably nothing tho. Stay safe out there anyway!"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3019442|public|self|Is Coinmarketcap Learn&amp;Earn Campaign a User Data Harvesting Scheme?

Instead, start with dollar-cost average purchases every week or every paycheck. Something you won't miss or won't sting if it all goes down 50% to 80% one day. If that's $10 dollars at a time for you then start with that, if it's $50 dollars at a time for you then go with that. Let that grow and work for you. It will motivate you to study Bitcoin to see why the value grows like it does once you see your own invested value starting to move up. Once you understand it enough to know why you hodl despite the temporary early-day volatility, then I would say it's okay to throw in such large amounts.

Invest responsibly people, only invest what your level of knowledge of an asset can tolerate. Use your investments to grow interested in an asset so you're motivated to look into it and understand it. Make your first dollars like a scouting party, have them go in and report back what they learn, and only after you've fully understood an asset thanks to the interest your scouts grow in your mind into understanding the asset's underlying fundamentals, only then should you invest with what that higher level of your knowledge of the asset will allow you to do so. This way, can you become the next Warren Buffet talking down to quantum coin buyers in 80 years or whatever the heck the next big money-making revolutionary network will be.

As for where to onboard, that depends on where you live. If you're in America, then your best bet is a place like Coinbase Pro. Free to use, and their fee for a $10 dollar buy is only around 5 cents. You can also use blockfi since they have no fees, but they tend to have a hefty markup. If anyone knows any other options for low fee purchases from secure exchanges with good reputable standings then please comment them below"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3020504|public|self|Start small with Bitcoin.

If you listen to commentators be they Peter Schiff to Michael Saylor understand no one can be absolute. Im not saying don’t include some of these commentators when carrying out due diligence just feel a lot of new investors out there are concentrating too much on what people are speculating rather than the developments/potential of the tech itself.

We had good spirits and I felt the urge to ask my notary what she thought of Blockchain as a way of securing data, since that is precisely what notaries do…

She said she wasn’t worried, that a notary still has many benefits that the blockchain can’t provide, etc. 
We talked about this for about ten minutes, but that isn’t the thing that’s important here. 

My notary is quite old, 60-65, and she immediately knew what I was talking about, so that means something. 

Go ask the average 60-65 year old what the blockchain even is and you probably won’t get an answer. 

The fact she knew what it was, discussed it with me and made an argumented claim on how it was no threat means she thought about it, possibly it is a (hot) topic amongst notaries in general?

Blockchain and thus Crypto is even bigger than we all may believe it to be…

I get we aren’t all of a single mind here but I’ve seen commentary about the idea if there are less people with upvotes somehow there is more moons for those who do get them. 

Even if this is true, why would someone go through the effort of just downvoting a whole swath of posts or comments? It can’t provide much of a lift and likely won’t benefit you in terms of a slightly higher payout than it would for the person just trying to be a part of the community and get a little bit also. 

It feels like knocking over some kid against the off chance it might net you more candy. 

It made me kind of sad to be reading one highly voted post and there were several screenfuls of comments at 0 votes which I understand means someone had to go through the trouble of just downvoting all of them. 

Anyway, guess this is just me venting. And the free wheeling anarchist I am, I’ll come up right behind you and try to upvote them all.

It's incredibly overwhelming when you're starting. What the hell are all of these cryptos for? Why do we need them all? Which one should I pick?

I think a lot of people struggle with similar questions when they're starting out. Eventually you have the ""Ah ha!"" moment. Many of these aren't competing with each other. Many of them are working together with each other. They're making each other better. Even if blockchains, protocols, or products are competing - that doesn't mean you have to pick ""the right one"". I'm not saying all of them will survive, but many of them will. I know many veterans know this, but many new people likely don't. Our future holds many interconnected blockchains, each with many products on it. Many of the products will be on several competing blockchains. They will exist together, communicate with each other, and eventually they'll probably provide a relatively seamless user experience even across different blockchains.

You need to swap Dai to xDai then xMoon then Moon (On RedditMoon.com for example) and this includes different networks etc .

If I build a website where you send ETH/USDT and receive Moons directly to your Vault, will you use it? What is the fee that you are willing to pay for such service?

I have the programming experience needed and I’ve worked for 3-4 Blockchains companies(And Solidity for sure ) so this work can be done in 1-2 weeks...
But the question is: are you going to use it, do you think it will help Moons grow etc?

If i find good interest, I’ll start building and updating progress here.

The first time I spend anything was when ETH was around 4K usd. Same goes for other coins like BTC, everything were close to their ATH. Eventually everything dipped little by little and I kept spending small amounts of money. This was so addicting till eventually I had spend more on ETH and ADA. Man I even remember asking my friend if I should buy more ETH or if it will drop more. He told me to just wait because it will most likely drop. Day later and it went up again. Got mad and bought when it dipped a little bit later. But then it dropped so much more to like 2.5K USD and even lower, really learned my lesson there. I was way too hasty to buy more.

I kept buying the dip which I'm proud I did. Even though I only bough the dips with ETH and ADA and it was worth it. But man crypto is really fun.

So basically the 2038 problem is similar to Y2K. The 2038 problem refers to the time encoding error that will occur in the year 2038 in 32-bit systems. This may cause havoc in machines and services that use time to encode instructions and licenses. The effects will primarily be seen in devices that are not connected to the internet.

Will this effect on hardware wallets?
 Will it affect on mining rigs, or certain coins hashing/blockchain computations?

Don’t yolo your rent money, or life savings, or any money you can’t afford to lose. Everyone gets it, money is money, but there is a massive difference between gambling away pocket money and gambling “life” money in these stocks.

Here are my thoughts;

Crypto is decentralised and can’t been turned off you would have to emp bomb all computers manufacturers and  start shutting down crypto farms to even attempt at ending crypto. That’s not going to happen the people would revolt in a major civil war and probably win.

You can’t ban crypto because it will just still exist and go underground. Every democratic free country will find a way to buy it through legitimate or illegal exchanges it doesn’t matter.

It’s technology moving at a quick pace you can not stop the technology moving forward, blockchain has huge uses to end corruption and make the world a better place. This cannot be stopped buy a government even if they tried.

China thinks we’re dumb. We’re humans just like you and have a choice to buy whatever we want, they ban BTC to promote their own China crypto coin but all that does is make us value BTC more and it puts it more on a pedestal.

The world needs BTC - a global digital currency controlled buy no government this is everyone’s coin. Gold and silver is great but in a digital world it can’t be traded fast enough.

Just like the internet movement, crypto and blockchain is the next big thing for humanity innovation and technology. The financial sector will be redesigned and reshaped by it for the better.

“This is the way”

Crypto offers a lot more to the world than just a better financial system. Content creation, Intellectual Property, corruption, cyber security, corruption, privacy the list is huge and the future is knocking on our doorstep."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3023162|public|self|There is no off switch|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nrqyn9/there_is_no_off_switch/|all_ads|6|1622742763.0|LEGACY|5c104cfc-d7c8-11e4-9d14-22000b6902b0|LEGACY|||||||||||2021-06-03 23:22:43+00:00|t3_nrqyn9|0|1|0.54||1||[]|False|False|[]||||[]|||False|||||||||||||||03_06_21|06_21|0.1058338|0.4481893|0.44597685|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.06887347251176834|0.13158805668354034|0.01260214764624834|0.5141336917877197|0.26247766613960266|0.010325027629733086

In this guide, it uses just one PC to do the mining. However, I have 3-4 PC's in my house that are suitable for this. 


I have heard that my own pool might work here, but if I just wanted to use this guide as a basis, would it be possible to use all these PC's in this way? 

Right now, I have three of them running this same miner, and it appears that at least two of them are working according to the MH/s rate that's being reported on Ethermine.org. According to the PC's, though, it's more than what's being reported. 


This is why I am curious if this guide is viable for multiple PC's, or if there's some other way of doing it.

Having a lot of trouble trying to sync my Kraken wallet to my koinly account.

When I generate the API I do the standard ones but when I sync it in, it only shows my holdings for EUR and the stake I have in DOT. Nothing else. It shows I have a certain amount of transactions, but won't reflect it on the dashboard. I use the kraken app mainly for all my deposits etc.

Probably a very straight forward answer to this, but I can't seem to make sense of it. Tried to go into my transaction history on the website and the trades.csv was totally empty. Probably because of my trades all being done on the app.

Would love the place with the biggest reward, as of course I bought it when it was high!  Then it dropped! 

Also, is there a lower limit that is needed to stake as I only have a few. 

I still need some more characters I believe for this too.  Is it still 250 for a post?

I actually recieved a few dms asking about the process. Which is what brings me back to this. I set up a sub to show you how you can create these cheaply on your own, without the 75 dollar price tag other marketed brands. If you like to take a look at the process, check out r/SteelPlateSeeds. 

Ive got all the info there for you to do this own your own. Also - as I realize not everybody has access to materials, or a garage full of metal and woodworking tools - I can supply you with the metal plates if you like.

I used to check the daily more than I would check the ticker. Whether the price was up/down . The daily caused me so much unnecessary anxiety.  If the price of BTC goes down half a percent, people scream the sky is falling. People are seriously bipolar over there.

I've held most of my portfolio through the bear market  I personally believe the bullrun isn't over so I won't be selling. Everyone has their own opinion on it but when the market is red and you read the daily, it's very hard to not think you are making the right choice.  Maybe I am wrong, no one here knows but I stopped letting a group of strangers get into my head. I still check the market often but it doesn't bother me if it's red or green. The daily provides no useful information and  just causes  un needed stress during fearful times. 

Things I'm guessing I have missed in the daily today besides the regular fud.

I was wondering if there were any crypto staking services that allow you to leave your crypto in your ledger. 

I like the idea of staking, I just really don’t like the risk of giving my coins away to a third party. 

Is every staking option similar to Gemini Earn, or is there a more secure option? Would BlockFi be better? And do any options exist that I can use in tandem with my ledger nano?

I'm trying to figure out if I should report or not report the trades I had for last year. I had some transactions, but don't even know how to track/trace them down. They were all done on apps/sites that don't keep track of transactions, so there's no history I can download. I've never cashed any out. I've never received any kind of IRS letter or 1099 from an exchange. I initially obtained crypto around 2015 or so when prices were cheap, and I only invested a little bit of money, maybe a few thousand. So, I know the gov is looking at amounts over 20k I think? But over time, the amount its worth has grown.

So, I dont even know if I should report anything or not? I see many people saying since they haven't cashed anything out, they aren't going to report anything. But actually, how feasible is this going forward in the future? How long will it be before the IRS starts looking at ALL accounts on exchanges going back in the early years?

Are there any good CPA's / tax attorneys that are recommended? I know of:

Gordon Law ($195 consultation fee - not sure if this is for just 1 advice phone call or what?)

Clinton Donnelly (not sure of his prices).

That's the only 2 I know of. Do they accept crypto for payment?

Or am I better off doing it myself? Is turbo tax sufficient

What are some sites/software for tracking down transactions? I think those automated sites/softwares only work with sites like coinbase?

Would I have to manually track down all my transactions?

ALso, I was scammed last year for a large chunk of my crypto. Is there anything I can report or any way I can use this as a write off or something?

I'm not sure, which subreddits would be good for this post? Thank you

(I posted another post not long ago about “rug pulls” in effort to have a discussion about it.) I learned my lesson on the first coin, but some other members forayed into other emerging coins that basically ended up being another scam. I’m just posting again to serve as a gentle reminder and warning, especially to newbies who are eager and enthusiastic about crypto, that this seems to be quite an easy thing to have happen, and to be very careful when taking chances on new or emerging crypto projects.

What’s interesting to me is that all the new “coins/projects” that I refer to above used the same tactic. Basically, they start a telegram group, Twitter etc, get people interested and excited, offer to let select group to get into the coin early. Once people start buying in, they restrict selling - ostensibly to keep liquidity, but in reality it is so your money is locked in. (Think: no refunds) Then the previously communicative “developers” disappear. And  so does your money.

I think this can happen even after a coin goes public, correct me if I am wrong, though perhaps it becomes harder to pull off then. 

I kind of wish there could be some sort of centralized list or database of these scam coins and their “developers” that people could  reference to avoid falling victim to these scams.

It’s one thing to lose money on investment into company or crypto that failed in good faith. You should always be prepared to lose your investment. But it’s altogether different when you are conned and your money is basically stolen from you."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3021775|public|self|To anyone new to, or who has just begun, learning about crypto…a post about scams:|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nrmqqs/to_anyone_new_to_or_who_has_just_begun_learning/|all_ads|6|1622731290.0|SELF-STORY|c301e03e-5ea6-11e8-8824-0efe9c7bcaa8|SELF-STORY|||||||||||2021-06-03 20:11:30+00:00|t3_nrmqqs|0|5|0.78||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]|||False|||||||||||||||03_06_21|06_21|0.1058338|0.4481893|0.44597685|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.06887347251176834|0.13158805668354034|0.01260214764624834|0.5141336917877197|0.26247766613960266|0.010325027629733086

1. Their ""NO FEES"" statement false. You can verify this by placing sell order. They always give you coin price below 3-4% market price, regardless of any coin. When I confronted them pointing this out, their response was, ""price volatility in the market"". To me it's horseshit, price volatility implies both above and below, however in their case it's always 3-4% BELOW.  You can verify it on the sell confirmation page.


2. Their $25 CRO token Sign Up bonus is simply gimmicks and false statement. They add this $25 worth CRO  token to your account after sign up, HOWEVER it's just GHOST money and you can't do Anything with it, because they FORCE you to apply for CREDIT CARD to claim this $25 CRO. What if you don't give a fuck about their credit card?
