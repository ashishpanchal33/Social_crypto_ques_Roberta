One day i met a guy in the library who was looking for a particular book on cryptocurrency, i can’t remember what it was but I’m sure it was cryptocurrency for dummies or something similar. We got to chatting and i set him up on Coinbase, Binance, Mercatox, Huobi, Nexo (wasnt aware of celsius etc at the time) CoinMarketCap and Blockfolio and gave him a list of 5 cryptocurrencies that i was investing in at the time that he should research and decide if he wants to invest into as well. He decided that day that he would invest in all of them just from the way he said i spoke so passionately about them and really seemed to know what i was talking about (this one still amuses me as I’m sure i know less now than i did then).

Today i received this [message](https://imgur.com/a/InYYYuH) out of the blue. 

Text Version:

“Hi ***** its **** *******, I’m not sure if you will remember me, i hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to let you know that thanks to your advice and help i managed to put money away every month and i invested it across 4 of the 5 cryptocurrencies you told me about when you said which ones would make good long term investments. 

2 months ago my dad was diagnosed with stage 2 lung cancer and with everything going on he was going to be waiting a while for surgery but thanks to you i was able to pay for him to get private surgery as soon as possible and hopefully have just enough left over to pay for him to get the best care until he recovers. I made sure to check and pay my taxes on it first as well like you said i should do if i ever did invest. 

I wish i could repay you somehow or give you a share of the profits but for now i will only be able to repeatedly say thank you, you helped save my dad’s life and my family and I can not thank you enough. I hope to one day show you a token of my gratitude for this. I told you before, i knew there was i reason i met you. This proves it. From the bottom of my heart thank you.”

This really made me smile.

Having had to sell pretty much all of my cryptocurrency over the last year at a loss just to survive I’ve been feeling quite down in the dumps having watched it explode over the last few months but receiving this message has made me feel so much better because at least if i couldn’t benefit from the increase lately then at least someone else and their family got to benefit thanks to the cryptos i picked out.

Cryptocurrency is changing lives around the world and still there is people who don’t believe in it or the underlying technology behind it. As someone who has known about bitcoin and the crypto space since pre-ethereum days i am really excited to see how the space as a whole advances over the next 10 years."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1872202|public|self|||Almost 2 years ago before i dropped out of Uni, i gave what may have been the best advice I’ve ever given.|5|[]|0.74|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m17it0/almost_2_years_ago_before_i_dropped_out_of_uni_i/||all_ads|6|1615280342.0|||||||||||2021-03-09 14:29:02+00:00|t3_m17it0|0|83||

We are in the market, where most of the people who have bought i last 6 months are deep in profit. The market seems bullish and I believe it can still remain like that for some time.

However, it does not mean that you shouldn't take profits. Any profit is good profit. Whether it is 10% or 2000% it is worth to take same of the profits and just feel that you earned some money. It's much much better to sell for small profit than to become bagholder for a long time. Bagholding will wreck you mentally. And by saying that I mean it will really wreck you unless you have nerves of steel. Imagine that you bough at coin that dropped 50%. In order for it to go back for you to break even it needs to go up 100%. So at the same time you not only need for it to go more than it dropped (percentage-wise), others will be doubling their profits while you will be barely breaking even. 

People who bought ADA 3 years ago at ATH, even after breaking even this year, they didnt make any profit for 3 years and lost some due to inlfation (not to mention opportunity cost).

I know there is strong ""HODL"" mentality among people here, but remember in the end everyone is trading for themselves. People tend to write ""HODL"", but you cant know what their financial situation is. Maybe they are just teenagers and invested few hundred bucks for fun and memes, even if they lose 500$ then its nothing. Or maybe they are gamblers (there are a lot of gamblers here) who get high when they risk and lose (or win) their money. But if you are trying to FOMO and invest bigger sums, it can quickly go bad, and no amount of memes can make it back what you lost. 

If you really want to HODL, imagine yourself bagholding several years with 90% portfolio loss of value (which is pretty common in crypto) and at the same time people getting 10000% of return on their investment. If this scenario does not sound painful to you then HODL mentality might be ok for you. But at the end of the day it might not be and you will be regretting not selling when you are 20% up, then you start hating cryptos adn when the actual good (Second) time to invest will come you will miss it again and regret it even more. 

As with another great bull run, there will same amount of newly made bagholders and millionaries. Because those newly made millionaries had to unload their cryptos to someone right?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Remember there is **ALWAYS** another play, but if you are bagholder then you can hardly do anything. If you sell at profit then great opportunity will eventually come and you will have even more to invest. Bagholding can really wreck you mentally, so think about taking some profits before you get too greedy and lose it all."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1873036|public|self|||Don't be scared to take profits.|1|[]|0.64|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m1c2j1/dont_be_scared_to_take_profits/||all_ads|6|1615292685.0||b0dd934c-ad7d-11e7-8466-0e3335a91874|||||||||2021-03-09 17:54:45+00:00|t3_m1c2j1|0|7||

If you're in the USA and you exchange $200 or less to a foreign currency, and transfer it back. Then you don't get taxed. So like if you go on vacation or whatever. But with crypto, this isn't the case at all. It's actually treated in the eyes of the gov as the same way a stock or baseball card would be. 

NOTE: I'm not a tax person. But as far as I can tell if you bought something or transfer that foreign money to another, then that isn't taxed. While in crypto this 100% happens. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like I think if I transfer the £ to ¥, I don't think the IRS can or does tax that. Where if I transfer BTC to ETH that does happen as far as I can tell. And I don't think if you took ¥ and bought something, that is taxed by the IRS. But if you bought 25 cent gum with BTC then it 100% is.

I've seen a lot of posts in this sub about their personal wins and I'd like to share my very small personal moon with you.

I invested in 2018, at the peak into...TRX. Roughly £800 lovely GBP. On the recommendation of a work colleage, my **boss** no less. Fuck!

Naturally, this over halved and I lost around 55% of my TRX. I ignored it, tried to HODL till late 2020 and realised my mistake of investing in TRX, especially on simply anothers word. I decided to get out, realise my losses of 55% and reinvest the rest.

I put around £400 in BTC/ETH/ADA in December and watched my 55% loss turn to 0% losses. Then into profit. I was GOBSMACKED. This was admittedly, very lucky timing on my part. I went for the two biggies and after about 5-10 hours research, ADA. This simple decision taught me one thing I'll never let go of:

***DYOR and never invest more than you can afford to lose***

I cashed out my losses and thought I'd start fresh. I re-invested the original amount and now sit at $1100. 

I'm really, really looking forward to the long term again in crypto. Seeing losses turn into profits really spurred me on. 


Thank you to this community, I've learnt far more than I could have dreamed from you all!"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1871067|public|self|||My own little triumph.|1|[]|0.83|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m139ma/my_own_little_triumph/||all_ads|6|1615263655.0|||||||||||2021-03-09 09:50:55+00:00|t3_m139ma|0|11||

I've been in crypto for years. I've seen all kinds of shitcoins come and go. I remember some hype around NEM back in the day and then nothing. Complete radio silence. Now that happens with hundreds of coins, but the difference is those coins fade into obscurity and out of the top 100.

NEM seems to have faded into obscurity but is still somehow permanently in the top 20. When was the last time you saw a post about NEM? a meme? I have never once seen anyone on CNBC, Bloomberg, youtube or a crypto podcast even in passing mention NEM. I've heard more about shitcoins that are 400th on CoinGecko than I do NEM. It seems to be no ones coin, in no ones indexes.

It doesn't have shill armies desperately posting propping up it's value. Where is its top 20 permanence coming from? Who are these silent hardcore NEM holders? Is there some African nation that has secretly moved their economy to NEM and not told anyone?

I'm finally understanding enough to see gains but lost about 400 on fomo and paper hands that I'm slowly getting back.

So my question is, I have a limited budget of about 100-200 a week that I can invest.  I have a few coins that for me are sure bets but I feel they're only short term after which they'll crest for a long time.  Then there's some alts that I want to get into that are very long bets but doing so will have a return much greater than the short ones.

So how does one balance that out, split 50/50, use the profit from short gains to invest into long?  Throw it all into doge and stop caring?

I'm not really looking for financial advice just ideas to consider."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1867890|public|self|||Long Vs Short?|0|[]|0.66|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m0oupm/long_vs_short/||all_ads|6|1615214582.0|||||||||||2021-03-08 20:13:02+00:00|t3_m0oupm|0|4||

I myself had to get my Cardarno through a friend because Binance hasn't verified me in over 3 weeks (WTF ARE THEY DOING?)

During the last 6 months I felt more at ease seeing ups and downs on my crypto portfolio than in my stock portfolio. 

I don't feel the urge for my cryptos to read every small headline that could affect my investment. If cryptos are down, I sometimes even hope they would drop more so that I could, for example, buy a BTC at corona levels. BTC can't say 'nah, we are planning for moderate growth next year' or 'well, we have to raise money to grow further'.

For my stocks, it's different. Last three weeks were really bad and I constantly ask myself if my decisions are right or not. 

I love my crypto portfolio and it made me smile in the last few weeks, even if it wasn't performing that strong.

Side note: Started with 5% allocation to crypto and have now roughly 10% invested in crypto. You could say that it's about the amount of money, but for me it's more of a 'fundamentals do not change that easily for crypto' thing."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1871350|public|self|||I feel more at ease looking at my crypto folio than looking at my stocks|0|[]|0.92|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m14ahw/i_feel_more_at_ease_looking_at_my_crypto_folio/||all_ads|6|1615268482.0||709d50a8-1deb-11e4-9b08-12313b0b24aa|||||||||2021-03-09 11:11:22+00:00|t3_m14ahw|0|38||

Yes you can spend BTC on things and ETH is a utility of sorts.  But its not cash.   At any time any of these cryptos could fall any amount in value.    


I hold ADA, ETH, TRON, ALGO, SOL and a few others.  I hope they appreciate and that I can trade them in for spendable assets one day, (wether thats cash or another crypto that I can spend, etc)  


But It I would be jumping the gun to say that I 'have' this cash atm.

Who are 465DI and what are we working on?

So there has been a few discussions around who we are, what we are doing with Nano and the usual digging to see what really might be going on. Lets give some background.

465 is a private equity group, founded by myself (Duncan) to manage various investments which have predominantly been in the technology, fintech and payments sectors. Our group is actually quite wide, having investments in roughly 90 companies spread fairly globally. We were an early stage investor in Facebook, Deliveroo and Revolut to name a few house hold names.

My background is technology and high frequency trading. Having started out building computers at a young age, I turned this into a business whilst at school which I ultimately sold in my early twenties. I then moved to the big smoke (London) and started working for a Chicago based prop fund called First Continental. I designed and built both hardware and software for their automated bond arbitrage systems. Laterly, I co-founded Kineta trading, a high frequency prop firm specialising in FX Arbitrage between Chicago and New York. If you have read flash boys, or seen the Hummingbird Project this was our game – latency arbitrage (This may be why I like Nano so much – I hate latency).

Post Kineta, another market maker specialising in FX was founded, Xenfin, which still runs today. It transacts a few billion of FX every day in a fully electronic, automated fashion in both New York, London and Tokyo. Our clients are predominantly banks.

Crypto became a hobby for me in early 2011, when we started to look at ASICS for bitcoin, we were already mining a few Alts on GPU’s, and in the early days also BTC. As a result, we built a mining company predominantly based in the UK, utilising the power from a renewable power plant that we also own. Today, we still mine BTC and ETH predominantly.

We have various other large scale projects in the banking and payments space. I am the chairman of a challenger bank based in Barcelona (NEO), and soon to also launch in the UK, that has aspirations to bolt on crypto to its offering.

Our group, also has some other well known individuals in the crypto space as part of it. These will become more visible as we build out. 465DI was built to consolidate our ‘crypto and blockchain’ holdings into a single entity.

So what are we working on and why Nano?

George &amp; Colin came to Xenfin with the very early idea of using nano in an FX pipeline and since then we have been watching nano with interest. Our next step is to see whether we can integrate nano into Neo, and how we can use it as payment rails for countries where payments are inefficient and expensive. Nano for us solves a few major issues, time for finality, and cost. These are the two main items that affect payments rails today in the traditional banking world. There are other issues, such as KYC, AML, banks holding funds etc that are also issues but that is not for discussion here. One other major issue that causes issues with other crypto’s is the TPS issue. The recent ‘Spam’ attack has shown the network is resilient, but that there are still things to address.

We have two main projects in the works right now:

(a) Crypto ATM’S, whilst people have thought we are producing a solely Nano ATM, that’s not the case, we will be providing ATM’s in multiple jurisdictions that can support the major Cryptos and also Nano. However, we will be pushing Nano as we believe it is the most efficient and cheapest crypto to enable worldwide payments. Think of a simple use case, the Dubai – India cash route back home. Workers in Dubai, send money back home. The current traditional routes can charge 10% for this and it takes days. With ATM’s / Nano you can pay into an ATM In Dubai, it arrives (via Nano) to the receiver almost instantly ready for withdrawal. These will be launched under the brand “Pinger” via www.pinger.cash in the coming months. We will be launching the website to show likely jurisdictions and to request partners / suggested locations for machines. We will operate these on a Joint Venture basis with local operators who will manage the ‘on the ground’ logistics.

(b) Institutional Nano Custody / Fiat – I am running a project at Neo to enable this. You will be able to hold nano with Neo, and instantly transfer between major currencies at wholesale rates. Currently this will be offered for Institutions / Corporates only. This will change long term to broaden user coverage.

Two other points:

(a) Relationship with Binance – for the record there is nothing official. We are using Binance for on road / off road fiat rails currently; this may change. However, we have committed to running large scale, robust nodes for Nano and Binance selected us to be used for their needs.

(b) We are happy to support Nano Projects with Hardware if it makes sense for us to do so. Feel free to PM if you have an interesting project that needs support.

We are keen to listen, I’m not very active on here, but plan to be. I like healthy debate, I like solving problems and I like to build things. I see a lot of people looking at the price of Nano, and sure I assume for most, this is just another investible with a potential return. We see it different, a utility that could allow the unbanked to be banked more easily. The by-product of adoption is an increase in price which in the long run isn’t a bad thing either."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1871258|public|self|||465di Private Equity group are developing NANO ATMs and more|0|[]|0.93|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m13z6p/465di_private_equity_group_are_developing_nano/||all_ads|6|1615267082.0||709d50a8-1deb-11e4-9b08-12313b0b24aa|||||||||2021-03-09 10:48:02+00:00|t3_m13z6p|0|12||

I've been interested in crypto for many years and put my first few bucks into bitcoin and Ethereum in 2017 but I never really understood how exactly it worked. In the last few months I've been researching more and more how crypto actually works and slowly have been putting money into the big names I see like cardano, stellar lumens, nano, Ethereum and bitcoin. I have a thousand and some change in savings that are just sitting in a no interest savings account.

NFTs is the ""New"" hot thing in crypto right now, People pay 10-2.5mil$ to buy an NFT.

NFT can be A [Tweet](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-taking-005308964.html) , A Clip from [NBA](https://www.nbatopshot.com/), A Picture or a [GIF](https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/my-last-effort--16458).

I Don't to want to claim that I Understand the motives behind these NFTs but **maybe just maybe** This is the Future.

# Year 2050:

we will Welcome our guests to our home, Lead them to our VR AR Room and show them all of our Digital art collection.

The room will be Empty as fk, maybe with some carpets and some cool lighting that will bring the best of our Digital Art Collection, We will show them Crazy Tweets, NBA clips and more.

The guest wouldn't need to do anything special to see our collections because they already can see them with their **Smart-Glasses** that everyone is wearing these days.

After that we will have some nice dinner made in the **Super-Microwave** by a luxurious capsules I bought with 0.00005 Bitcoin and they will ask us about the Digital painting that is represented on one of the walls.

One of my guests REALLY love that painting (even tho I painted it in Paint2045.exe) and he wants to buy it for 0.005 Bitcoin! OMG im so excited right now!

We hop into our favorite wallet and exchange it in a fast and feeless way.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe It's the future, Maybe I have seen too many movies, Either way we are gonna have a great ride.

What do you think on the future of NFTs?

So, I won like $1,900 or so last year on the pokies, their only withdrawal method was via bitcoin and i made a coinbase account

1.  This could work similar to torrents, content creators host (seed) their own video and people that watched a certain video would also seed it until a certain seed/leech ratio is reached. This manner of video sharing is not possible through a web browser, so an app / program has to be developed, this should be open source and be developed by a non-profit organization like Wikipedia.   
2. The content creators earn revenue by video sponsorship/advertising in the video itself.   
3. I guess that for mobile devices, this should be done best for WiFi connections only, I don't think this would be a problem since mobile devices aren't the majority.   
4. To circumvent perverted/gorish/copyright-infringing videos becoming common on this platform, there should be a form of oversight. It seems best to me that this would be controlled by a non-profit organization that uses a mix of (a.) reporting by users/creators, (b.) using neural networks to detect nudity/extreme gore/copyright-infringement/etc., (c.) paid workers that verify videos that are randomly picked from the pool of user-reported videos or videos that are flagged by the neural networks. The code of the neural networks should be open source like the applications.  
5. To pay the workers mentioned in item 4. and to possibly pay developers of the application/neural-networks i see three options: (a.) content creators are forced to donate a certain percentage of their revenue. A combination of these options is of course also possible, (b.) donorships similar to Wikipedia or (c.) advertising in the application itself.  
6. To reward users from correctly reporting videos and to reward users that seed above average a new cryptocurrency could be introduced. This currency is to be spend on content creators. Content creators that receive this currency have to pay a lower percentage of their revenue to the non-profit organization.  


Several major problems that come to mind in realizing this are:  
1. Design of the search and recommendation algorithm. These two majorly impact the growth of a content creators channel. Even small changes could result in a major impact on some channels and would therefore cause a big backlash from the content creator community. The design of a fair and neutral search and recommendation algorithm are in my point of view, extremely challenging. This could even go as far as content creators paying developers secretly such that they make changes in the algorithms that benefit these creators. A method should obviously be in place that prevents this.  
2. Many users and content creators are needed to make this work initially, as well as a properly designed app / program.  
3. Scaling issues, the seed/leech ratio becomes a bottleneck for trending videos and when the number of users grows very fast in a short amount of time.  
4. Defending against bot-networks that (a.) flag videos incorrectly or (b.) bots that watch videos of a certain content creator to inflate his/her revenue.  


What do you guys think. Does this have a chance to succeed? What needs to be added or changed for it to do so?

I will share the link to the original post in the comments. Original submission below:




Who are 465DI and what are we working on?

So there has been a few discussions around who we are, what we are doing with Nano and the usual digging to see what really might be going on. Lets give some background.

465 is a private equity group, founded by myself (Duncan) to manage various investments which have predominantly been in the technology, fintech and payments sectors. Our group is actually quite wide, having investments in roughly 90 companies spread fairly globally. We were an early stage investor in Facebook, Deliveroo and Revolut to name a few house hold names.

My background is technology and high frequency trading. Having started out building computers at a young age, I turned this into a business whilst at school which I ultimately sold in my early twenties. I then moved to the big smoke (London) and started working for a Chicago based prop fund called First Continental. I designed and built both hardware and software for their automated bond arbitrage systems. Laterly, I co-founded Kineta trading, a high frequency prop firm specialising in FX Arbitrage between Chicago and New York. If you have read flash boys, or seen the Hummingbird Project this was our game – latency arbitrage (This may be why I like Nano so much – I hate latency). 

Post Kineta, another market maker specialising in FX was founded, Xenfin, which still runs today. It transacts a few billion of FX every day in a fully electronic, automated fashion in both New York, London and Tokyo. Our clients are predominantly banks. 

Crypto became a hobby for me in early 2011, when we started to look at ASICS for bitcoin, we were already mining a few Alts on GPU’s, and in the early days also BTC. As a result, we built a mining company predominantly based in the UK, utilising the power from a renewable power plant that we also own. Today, we still mine BTC and ETH predominantly. 

We have various other large scale projects in the banking and payments space. I am the chairman of a challenger bank based in Barcelona (NEO), and soon to also launch in the UK, that has aspirations to bolt on crypto to its offering.

Our group, also has some other well known individuals in the crypto space as part of it. These will become more visible as we build out. 465DI was built to consolidate our ‘crypto and blockchain’ holdings into a single entity.

So what are we working on and why Nano?

George &amp; Colin came to Xenfin with the very early idea of using nano in an FX pipeline and since then we have been watching nano with interest. Our next step is to see whether we can integrate nano into Neo, and how we can use it as payment rails for countries where payments are inefficient and expensive. Nano for us solves a few major issues, time for finality, and cost. These are the two main items that affect payments rails today in the traditional banking world. There are other issues, such as KYC, AML, banks holding funds etc that are also issues but that is not for discussion here. One other major issue that causes issues with other crypto’s is the TPS issue. The recent ‘Spam’ attack has shown the network is resilient, but that there are still things to address.

We have two main projects in the works right now:

(a) Crypto ATM’S, whilst people have thought we are producing a solely Nano ATM, that’s not the case, we will be providing ATM’s in multiple jurisdictions that can support the major Cryptos and also Nano. However, we will be pushing Nano as we believe it is the most efficient and cheapest crypto to enable worldwide payments. Think of a simple use case, the Dubai – India cash route back home. Workers in Dubai, send money back home. The current traditional routes can charge 10% for this and it takes days. With ATM’s / Nano you can pay into an ATM In Dubai, it arrives (via Nano) to the receiver almost instantly ready for withdrawal. These will be launched under the brand “Pinger” via www.pinger.cash in the coming months. We will be launching the website to show likely jurisdictions and to request partners / suggested locations for machines. We will operate these on a Joint Venture basis with local operators who will manage the ‘on the ground’ logistics.

(b) Institutional Nano Custody / Fiat – I am running a project at Neo to enable this. You will be able to hold nano with Neo, and instantly transfer between major currencies at wholesale rates. Currently this will be offered for Institutions / Corporates only. This will change long term to broaden user coverage.

Two other points:

(a) Relationship with Binance – for the record there is nothing official. We are using Binance for on road / off road fiat rails currently; this may change. However, we have committed to running large scale, robust nodes for Nano and Binance selected us to be used for their needs.

(b) We are happy to support Nano Projects with Hardware if it makes sense for us to do so. Feel free to PM if you have an interesting project that needs support. 

We are keen to listen, I’m not very active on here, but plan to be. I like healthy debate, I like solving problems and I like to build things. I see a lot of people looking at the price of Nano, and sure I assume for most, this is just another investible with a potential return. We see it different, a utility that could allow the unbanked to be banked more easily. The by-product of adoption is an increase in price which in the long run isn’t a bad thing either."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1871505|public|self|||ATMs featuring Nano coming soon and much more...|0|[]|0.86|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m14q2f/atms_featuring_nano_coming_soon_and_much_more/||all_ads|6|1615270381.0|||||||||||2021-03-09 11:43:01+00:00|t3_m14q2f|0|10||

My question goes to the people who’ve been trading cryptos longer than the average (I imagine rather recent) users here: are there any investments of yours that have really taken a nose-dive for you?

People are starting to consider crypto to be a safe-haven against the traditional monetary system empowered by banks worldwide. Yet, the vast majority still relies on Fiat for day-to-day transactions because of its price stability and widespread acceptance in the mainstream world.

With the advent of privacy coins, people can enjoy true financial freedom like never before. Privacy coins can become attractive tools for illicit activities because of their untraceable blockchain ledger. Despite all of the benefits privacy coins provide, criminals still rely on Fiat for all of their nefarious actions. I'm starting to wonder why, since Fiat (physical cash) is not as anonymous as one thought it would be. Privacy coins are truly anonymous (especially those that are private by default like Monero and Grin), as there is no central authority behind them. Maybe criminals prefer Fiat because of its high level of adoption in the mainstream world? Or maybe because Fiat has an easier learning curve than crypto?

If by any means criminals start adopting crypto in mass (especially privacy coins), we could expect a full government crackdown on the entire industry. Which is why I think it's best for criminals to continue using Fiat for the sake of the crypto/Blockchain industry's growth worldwide. But we'll never know what will happen in the future.
