I've only been in the crypto game since mid 2017. I remember back then when I was assessing the market, BTC was below $1k a few months earlier, LTC was around $4 that January and by the time I finally got in BTC had more than doubled to around $2,500 and LTC was $30. I thought ETH and XRP (and everything else) were just shitcoins because I didn't know shit and I just listened to the herd (Back then the argument was ""Bitcoin is digital gold and LTC is digital silver and everything else is a scam."") Now, I'm pretty invested in several coins, because this market is anything but rational.

Screw off if you think otherwise. Try to think logically in this market, and you're going to get smacked in the face.

After exchanging my first fiat for crypto, in the next couple of months the market ""crashed"" and I was fearful. By crashed, I mean BTC went from $2,800 to $1,800. I just decided to let my cryptos ride. I pretended that money was gone, but I'd check prices every day for whatever damn reason.

I wasn't even putting that much in. Hell, I would spend more eating out and going to the bars every weekend with friends or work colleagues than I was dropping into BTC. It was pretty common that I'd drop $100 a night on sushi, beers, and Sake Bombs. But, when money you could get back loses value, it makes you feel dumb for putting money in. Logic is out the window when I can't get that $100 back from my sushi and drink purchases, but my crypto dropped 30% that week, so I was dumb for investing in crypto but not for my $500+ per month on eating out and drinking with friends.

Several weeks later, I was back to even on my crypto investments. Well shit, that was fast. Then I was suddenly up 25%. ""Fuck it, I'm just putting money in. I'm not missing out.""

By the the winter of 2017, I was up over 10x with my crypto speculation. My initial LTC went from $30 to over $350; my BTC went from $2,500 to $20,000. I also just threw $300-$1,000 here and there on random sub-200 market cap coins only to see them 6x in a few weeks.

I remember thinking how stupid I was for not buying during that dip down to $1,800, but how good of an investor I was because my gains. What a fucking dope I was.

I was sitting there looking at my account on December 10th, 2017. I was about to sell because I could have paid off my car and 50% of my student loans. I wasn't even using my car because I was in another country traveling.

""Nah, I can't sell. This is just the beginning; let's wait until I can pay off all my student loans"" my delusional self said.

I never cashed out. I remember sitting there with a dude who had his GDAX account open after BTC ""crashed"" from $20k to $13k two weeks later. We just got back from surfing.

He was still sitting at $250,000 in his account and was nervous as shit. ""What should I do?"" he asked rhetorically. Then immediately answered himself, ""It will rebound,"" he said, ""it always does."" This guy had been through the MTGOX hack and gave me plenty of advice while we surfed.

And I listened as if he was prophetic.

What a fucking dope I was.

When hopium is in the air, we all get irrational.

I still wonder about that guy and his cryptos. He went north back home for the Christmas holiday, while I headed south for more traveling, and I've never seen him again.

February 2018 was both euphoric and scary as shit. ""Holy shit! BTC is under $10k I never thought it would be down here again. But it could keep dropping. But it was just $20k a month ago.""

I was skeptical that it wouldn't keep dropping so I waited. Then, I didn't want to miss out. BTC was making a run from $6,500 up to testing $10k. ""If it breaks $10k, I'm getting back in.""

A short time later, it did break $10k, only to be hit a wall at $12k, then again...then, the inevitable crash to $6,200 happened where it fluctuated in August - November of 2018 up until, what, November 10th-ish when BCH shitfork shat out and then BTC-Shit-Vision and BTC-LMNOP started paying miners to mine their forked fork of BTC and everyone shat themselves as the market tanked yet again.

That was it for me. That was the day I stopped caring. I remember thinking how stupid I was to invest so much time in this.

You can't predict this shit.

I didn't regret investing in crypto, I regret all the time spent looking at my portfolio, trying to time the market, pretending I was some guru in my head because I threw $300 at POE when it was less than a penny and weeks later it was selling for $0.21 and could buy another trip to whatever country I wanted.

Sure, you can use TA to see what support or resistance is there, but it's still a 50-50 chance whether Fake Satoshi is going to spoof trade or some rando is going to drop three 7,000 BTC market buys to break through resistance.

So, what did I learn through this whole experience?

Other than what I've already stated (You have no way to predict whether it's breaking through resistance or crashing through support).

I just remember the main thing that has persisted this last two years. ""I wish I could go back in time to when BTC was around $3,000 and LTC was $30.""

When BTC dropped below, $4k that was heaven. I never thought it would get back to when I was buying when I first got into the market in 2017.

So, I bought, and I bought hard.

This time around, I have strong buy strategies and sell strategies.

They are set; no question.

For me, I'm not selling until two weeks before the LTC halving in August.

Even then, I'm only selling my LTC for BTC. Then I'll sell 25% of my BTC for fiat 2 weeks before the BTC halving in 2020.

I will never have less than my preferred number of BTC's, ETH's, LTC's and a few others.

Don't follow my advice here, I'm just saying I know what I want and what my strategy is.

You need to have a strategy to buy and strategy to sell. Be reasonable. I previously had a ""strategy."" It was once I could pay off my student loans with all of my crypto gains minus taxes, I would sell. Yeah, well, looking back if I would have just sold when could pay off my car and 50% of my student loans, I would have been able to invest even more when BTC was down in $3,xxx range and LTC was $22-$35, etc from December 2018 through March 2019.

DCAing is the way to go. No question. You don't need to do TA, you don't need to check your portfolio, you don't need to do shit but either 1) setup an automatic buy order with your exchange or 2) login and buy whatever you want.

You have your buy strategy (DCA at x interval) and you have your sell strategy.

Figure it out. Don't pretend you're gonna time the market. Don't pretend you're some guru.

Those people, like me, learn the hard way.

No TA, no waiting for google searches of BTC to increase, no waiting for BAKKT, no waiting for Faktoshi to shut the fuck up.

Before November 2018, I would only throw money when BTC was on a run. ""Oh, we're finally on the way up. It's time to buy!"" Like when it went from $2,800 up to $6,200 in the summer 2017, then from $10k to $20k in late 2017. Or when it went from $6,200 back up to $10,000 then to $11,900 in February of 2018.

I would think I could time the market. What a pathetic loser, right?

Some people grow up in this market like the cable version of themselves only to transition to the directv version. Listen to us dopes that have been there and done that.

Learn from our mistakes, but also don't think that we have all the damn answers.

Anyone that comes in here acting like the 2nd coming of Craig Wright's dumpster twin, you can be rest assured they are as delusional as Justin Sun. The problem is, even if they are delusional, this market is anything but rational, so they might just be proven right enough for you to think you should follow their advice.

This shit is crazy. Stop acting like you've got it figured out.

Nobody does, but it feels good to have confidence in this random speculation, right?

I'm here to tell you this. My life has drastically improved since November 2018 when I started viewing Crypto investments like a bill. Every two weeks, I would send money from my paycheck to my exchange. Then, I'd buy a certain amount every single week after it had cleared.

That money, is all but ""gone.""  It was a ""bill"" I paid.

When the market is going down, I send more fiat and I buy more crypto. When it is rising, I still buy, but not as much; I pull back. You may say I'm trying to catch a falling knife. I just learned that the way I was investing before was bad practice. I'd rather people think I'm trying to catch a falling knife than to feel that FOMO and only buy when the market is up.

Right now for example, I'm not buying this week. Not because I think I know what hell is going to happen, but because it's my strategy to not chase a run, and to spend more when it drops.

I'll wait until next weekend and see what the market is doing.

What happens in between now and next weekend, I don't give a shit.

Could I miss out on another run? Sure, but I don't give a shit. Maybe it's because I'm 2 years in and I've seen this shit before, or maybe it's because I've been buying BTC when it was around $3,000 both in 2017 and just about a month ago, so I feel fortunate to have gotten another chance at BTC at $3,xxx.

I also learned my lesson that fakeouts happen. I've been burned enough to not give a shit about being BTC going from $3500 to $5,200 in the last, what, 5 weeks?

Been here, done it, don't give a shit.

I don't know if this helps anyone, but seeing the last two years of this shit, I don't care about some random 30% pump. I also don't care that BCH is up 86%, or ADA is up whatever it is. I'm not into them, but if you made gains, I'm happy for you.

I'm serious too. 

Maybe you're new to this game, or maybe you've only been in since $20k. If so, you're still here, and there are plenty others like you. I'm not a BTC maximalist, I don't think LTC is the truth, I don't think only ETH is the dApp platform.

I don't know shit. I'm just some speculator that is speculating on some of this sit.

There are also plenty of people that were like me in 2017 that are waiting in the wings, only to buy when the market is on the rise. There are plenty more that buy when it's rising then set stop losses that whales will fish for only to wreck the market in a day then to see a bounce back even stronger while those people FOMO back in.

Also, the turd version of satoshi could start shitting in public this week and the media could write about how Satoshi is literally shitting on a physical Bitcoin as we speak and some shitcoin creator then posts a Twitter video that goes viral about how the hashrate and energy consumption of the satoshi shit-pile is not sustainable and then some whale market sells down to below the new TA shit-support level of $4,400 and then all the dopes with stop losses in that range get shit fucked only to see a spoof limit order set at $4,400 of 10,000 BTC and everyone's dick shrinks into their stomach as they hurry to Tether as BTC drops back down to $3,500 before whale #2 shit fucks your emotions with a $1,500 green dildo in a 15 minute span sees the ""sell wall"" disappear which starts the next FOMO run on up to $6,200 a few weeks later while TAers say ""We broke out on great volume"" then other TAers agree and the self-fulling prophecy starts another run only to get hit with more whale fuckers.

You can't predict this shit. Give it up.

Market goes up, market goes down, can't explain that.

With the LTC halving in August, the BTC halving in May 2020, I think we are about to get into the 2017 euphoria again though. We are getting close^(TM) to the point you could just thrown money at any coin and get 10x your investment.

What does ""close"" mean? I have no idea. Eff anyone that thinks they know. Someone could predict it is this week, next month, or after this current fakeout bull run, or in December, or next Spring, and someone will be right.

The only advice I have is to do your best to not get emotional about your money or crypto. It's going to do the exact opposite of what you think it will. Even when you try to do the opposite, crypto will shit-fuck you in your sleep.

If you believe that the sentiment is changing, and let's be real, we are in speculation phase and this is all based on hopium and belief, then DCA at certain intervals.

This isn't some cult. It's all based on sentiment. If you think people are starting to get interested, then that is a sign speculation is about to be in our favor.

If you are putting money in that needs to be rent money, do yourself a favor and just walk into a casino and put it all on red. If you win, then put your winnings in crypto. If you lose, I saved you the anguish of checking your portfolio every hour only wish you would have done the opposite of what you did.

You're welcome...

Or, do the opposite. Check the market every hour for the next 12 months only to look back and realize that you kept buying on the way up, got scared and sold on the way down, and then FUD yourself in your sleep because of your stop loss sells were triggered while whales were fishing for fear.

**So, there are all of my shit thoughts. What are yours?**

What are your strategies?

There are plenty of people that have been in longer than me, what are your strategies?

Are we heading for a the next bull run? Is the bottom in? Do we still have a massive, short-lived capitulation event coming?

Let's chat.

**TL;DR**: You can't predict this shit, just DCA, live your life, get a buy strategy, choose a sell point, make this shit as simple as possible. If you try to complicate things by predicting the next run, the next drop, the next consolidation, then you're probably going to be wrong like 99% of people. And don't be that guy that ends up $250,000 in your account in the next bull run only to see it drop down $67,000 literally a week later.

Together with the team we decided to check which exchange has the fastest support service. Both popular exchanges and exchanges that are only gaining momentum have been included in our survey.

We evaluated the response time, the advantages and disadvantages.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's go.

&amp;#x200B;

Binance

&amp;#x200B;

—The response time is 25 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Advantages:

— Support for English, Spanish, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, German, Russian, Turkish, Polish, Dutch, Vietnamese

— After this, a transition takes place to the main account window, where an alert pops up recommending installing 2fa authentication.

— When filling out the query box, help articles pop up from the user knowledge base.

— The Activity log is a record about from which device and when a login was made.

&amp;#x200B;

Disadvantages:

— Overloaded registration process. Already at this stage, the user is offered to accept three agreements (processing of Personal Data among them) and filling in important details, including the phone number (with SMS verification), the address, and full name.

— The main emphasis is on call-center support, there seem to be no other support branches.

— There is no support chat, no Telegram group. In fact, you can only interact through email.

&amp;#x200B;

OKEx

&amp;#x200B;

— The reply time is 10 minutes

&amp;#x200B;

Advantages:

— A large number of channels for receiving support — Telegram, Twitter, FB, Medium, Weibo

&amp;#x200B;

Disadvantages: Support in China only by email,the  chat support is also in Chinese.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitmex

&amp;#x200B;

— Response time - by email, it is up to 2 hours of waiting for an answer.

&amp;#x200B;

Advantages:

—A large number of channels for support: Reddit, Twitter, email

&amp;#x200B;

Disadvantages:

— If you did not receive a letter to activate your account during registration, forwarding is not possible.

— There is no error output when re-registering with the same mailbox, a code pops up that an ordinary user may not understand.

&amp;#x200B;

Xena Exchange

&amp;#x200B;

— The response time is 5 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Advantages:

— The support interaction window is located in the help center.

— Fast navigation on topical issues in the help center.

— The highest support rating among all respondents.

&amp;#x200B;

Disadvantages:

— Many notifications by email

— Lack of support in Spanish and Chinese

&amp;#x200B;

HitBTC

— The response time is 15 minutes

&amp;#x200B;

Advantages:

— Languages ​​- Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, English

— There is an option of selecting a native language (apparently, to redirect to a specific group of support agents)

&amp;#x200B;

Disadvantages:

— Too many ""barriers"" to reaching the support service.

— In the absence of a selected category, a request cannot be formed, although it is not clear how can new cases and categories be formed in that case.

— The logic by which a user can try to register from one mailbox under both a regular and pro account is not thought out entirely. If the mailbox is already registered under one of the accounts, the user is not informed why the box can no longer be used for registration.

&amp;#x200B;

The post turned out to be quite large. As part of a test, we reviewed more than 20 exchanges. If you are interested, we will post the second part. Spoiler: there is an absolute leader in this list of five exchanges.

Unfortunately, I was censored immediately by auto-moderator, probably because of some keyword I used, as seen on this [snew link](https://snew.notabug.io/r/Bitcoin/comments/b5bgmk/we_need_to_report_the_twitter_account_bitcoin_for/) (I'm one of 2 censored instantly posts).

Please note that I don't post on [r/bitcoin](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoin) often, don't even visit anymore, and my last comment there was 7 months ago. And yesterday - BAM.

By now, you're probably interested to see what I wrote, so here's my comment in full:

&gt;@Bitcoin account is the living proof that there exist people that once were bitcoin supporters. As real bitcoin supporters as you are now. And they saw the change that happened in the bitcoin software and the bitcoin community. And they changed their mind, not really about what the bitcoin means to them, but about what the bitcoin has become.  
Nobody bought/stole the @Bitcoin account. There are many of us that changed our mind, and I can tell you, bitcoin is not what it used to be. I used to be a bitcoin supporter, I mined my first BTC in 2012, I ran the full node, I ate the burgers paid by bitcoin in 2014. And although I did all that things, and supported BTC 100%, I changed my mind when I saw the $0.5 fee, a thing that was ridiculed as impossible just a few years before. And I saw the $50 fee, and paid \~$10 fee to escape from BTC to Bitcoin Cash. And I saw the BTC to alt dominance slip from 90% to \~30%.  
Let me ask you, why do you think there is only one Linux kernel? Why do you think there was 90% BTC market dominance? Answer is the same - it is not easy to do the fork. If I were to fork the BTC in 2012 (as many have), it wouldn't have any value. All alts put together had less than 5% of value of BTC market cap. If I were to fork the Linux kernel, nobody would use it. Nobody would contribute to it. I would need to do miracle to do better than existing linux community, attract more better developers, attract the users, and do all that hard work. Why would I do that, if I already have working Linux kernel, and I can freely contribute to it, and it will continue to serve my needs?! Well, the same cannot be said for bitcoin. Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System is not money if I need to pay significant fraction of the transaction to the miner fees. And it is very easy for me to fork BTC, and acquire a lot of supporters that don't like the current state of bitcoin. Even those that oppose the fork will leave the bitcoin because it became unusable, and align themselves for some of the other promising altcoins.  
Look up the LibreOffice, MariaDB, and stories behind them, and you will see what the Bitcoin Cash is. It's no fake copy, it's the original.  
For anyone interested in the history of bitcoin, look up who Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn were, and what they did. Let me know if you think you are better supporter of BTC then they were.  
For anyone who thinks I'm imagining things, please be assured, I lived through it, I was where you are now, and here's the truth written up in details: [https://hackernoon.com/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline-6108081dbada](https://hackernoon.com/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline-6108081dbada)"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|863572|public|self|Banned on r/bitcoin for a comment that didn't even show up|1554843226|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/bawrxh/banned_on_rbitcoin_for_a_comment_that_didnt_even/|all_ads|6|1554725681.0||dark|||||||||||{'f5kadx7tu2r21': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'f5kadx7tu2r21', 'm': 'image/png', 's': {'u': 'https://i.redd.it/f5kadx7tu2r21.png', 'x': 822, 'y': 261}, 'status': 'valid'}}|||2019-04-08 17:44:41+00:00|t3_bawrxh|0|0|0.5||0|

I am here to ask the community for help and explain to you my story.

Me and a few other people have came up with a good idea for a start up using cryptocurrencies and blockchain and having an ICO or Token Sale to raise funds. We all invested 10k each for 30k in total. 
The idea wasnt like 90% of the rest of cryptocurrency projects or Token Sales, ours has a real purpose and can bring about a real positive change in the world. 
We have spent the last year developing our idea, making final changes, and getting all the documents and legal work done and are in the last stages before going public.

We recently hired a Blockchain Developing firm and hired two people from their team as team members on our team. in short, to have both on team, it was around 11,000 USD.
One of them was hired to be our main developer, and they were supposed to develop with their team our Website, Our ICO Dashboard (user and admin panel, with payment gateway integration and ICO owner wallet integration) , our MVP (8 pages + rewards basic + ranking basic + Voting basic)  and our Smart contracts, Token and Wallet. 

Long story short, we have paid them so far over 6500 and all they have to show for is a 'pitch deck' which is pretty much created by us since we provided all the content and work and edits.
And we have the whitepaper technology sections written, but we only have the PDF version and they have not provided us with the .ai version.

They are holding onto our Code for the MVP, and our User/Admin panel until we pay them for the smart contracts and we pay them an additional 2500 to take the CTO onto the team. 
As per the contract, all the development work must be done before we take the CTO onto the team (which is paid 2500 to be on team + a % of funds rasied) and yet they are holding the Code on the MVP, User/Admin panel. Which we have fully paid for and have paid 2k about for the Admin/user panel, 1.7k for the MVP (which is not really operational, just a window/example of what our platform could look like), and 1k for the whitepaper. 
We were going to pay them without an issue the 2.5k at the end of the development work, but now that this company is holding our Code hostage and that their work is months over due as we paid for things like the MVP back in november 2018. That means its been 6 months + 6.5k in payments and all we have is a PDF version of our whitepaper with the technology sections 90% done since there still needs a few edits.

We are in a horrible position currently because we are a small start up who is currently spending 20k for Regulatory, incorporation and lawyer fees, and has lost the majority of our last 10k to this rip off of a company which is refusing to release our code and have been the worst since the start. 

I can write stories and stories of how many times we have had problems with them, for example, if you ever try to talk about the quality of their work or their faults/errors, they take it 
as an attack and start saying stuff like: 'think before you speak as words have consequences' or 'you are suggesting that i have not done what i am supposed to, i have and in the contract its not specifically written that i must do that so i am not going to' or many other things but i am not here to rant, i am here to try to find a solution to my problem.

What i am currently looking for is a blockchain / Smart contract / Back-end Developer who is able to help us develop our Admin/user Panel (we have a template purchased, we just need back-end)
and is also able to help us develop our Smart Contract and Our ERC-20 Tokens for our ICO. As for the MVP, we just need a little bit of back-end help since most of the MVP is just an example and
only a few things will be operational.

If anyone is able to help us, we would greatly appreciate it. We currently have a very small budget left and we still have to do the work above plus do a bit of marketing. We could consider other ways of working together such as maybe a small % of the funds raised from the ICO and being a team member or something similar, we are open to all suggestions and options and appreciate all your help."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|863164|public|self|ICO Start up Needing Developer Help or Some Advice|1554758293|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/bal9dp/ico_start_up_needing_developer_help_or_some_advice/|all_ads|6|1554652112.0||||||||||||||||2019-04-07 21:18:32+00:00|t3_bal9dp|0|1|1.0||0|
