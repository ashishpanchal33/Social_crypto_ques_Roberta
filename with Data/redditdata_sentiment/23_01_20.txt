It is somewhat understandable that a lot do not want to read the whole thing. I will try to recap the most \'important\' or viable questions for the current state of development. As always, I will include a juicy Tl;dr at the end.\n\n**General Development Direction and Product Adoption**\n\n*""We believe that decentralization, in the upcoming years, will not only be needed, but will be inevitable. We’re then preparing for when that time comes, as we are aware that Golem will need to grow robuster and then, the worries of low requestor supplies, will be a thing of the past. Taking into account how dependent we have become from corporations we believe that this trend will have to change and we have to be ready. Nowadays, the adoption is not going as quickly as we expected, and as quickly as we all wished for. Not only for the Golem network but for the whole cryptospace. We believe this is a moment to think progressively and overcome doubts by bulding.""*\n\n(*Viggith) ""We\'re almost about to become Clay officially. Reaching this milestone gave us a lot of opportunities to learn. As the whole process took quite some time, we could observe the development decisions made in other projects, how the tech stack matured, and how expectations in the community changed shape.""*\n\n""*Right now we’re mostly focused on the general platform development rather than working on deep development of integrations. It doesn’t mean that we’re not actively looking for the new ones, we just want to encourage devs to build their own rather then build them interally. However, we have several examples and PoCs that are being integrated - computational chemistry software for one of the scientific research projects from IChO, the transcoding use- case is at its MVP stage. We are also investigating the usage of gWASM for gas price optimization for Ethereum, and we had a PoC for a meta-use case with tools for devops’. We are striving to improve the existing software including Task API, so that the gWASM and Task APIusers will propose new integrations.""*\n\n**Task API Launch and Concent**\n\nLast week, the Task API launched on Testnet which allows users to build their tasks on the Golem Network. This has been perceived to be the largest component that will transition Golem from the Brass stage, to Clay. For more information and elaboration on Concent, see [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/epylz3/welcome_to_the_first_2020_golem_ama_january_22nd/ff9h75z?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\n*""We worked on the task-api component with a small and agile team, with proper planning and preparation we were able to not have big hiccups. The largest changes where that subtask-id was only unique when combined with task-id. The largest fights with code were about windows exceptions and the issues between twisted and asyncio. Twisted is our old async library, asyncio is the new one that has better native python support.*\n\n*For the mainnet release we would like to have more use-cases, better developer utilities and a lot of testing, by the team and the community. The main focus is to stabilize the task-api""*\n\nFor quick examples of the Task API:\n\n*""As examples for the task-api we made two apps: \\`blenderapp\\` and \\`tutorialapp\\`. blenderapp can be run by anyone on the current testnet using* [*these instructions*](https://taskapi.docs.golem.network/#running-a-task-on-task-api)*. tutorialapp can be build and run locally using* [*these instructions ( NOTE: technical )*](https://taskapi.docs.golem.network/#building-the-tutorial-app)*. As for tests we made unit tests on almost all levels: the apps, connecting libraries and golem core. In Golem core there are also multiple integration tests to test integration with core, one for testing blenderapp, one for testing apps while developing them.""*\n\n**Other Usecases for Golem on the Horizon**\n\n*""We did some research on integrating BOINC and BOINC-like computations. For now it seems that it is technically possible. But it will require more effort. Recently we are planning to try to cross-compile seti@home to gwasm application for the start and run it on mainnet. Another possible way is to use the testnet Task API as you mentioned. In general, it would be better to do so on mainnet but we need to wait for the release.*\n\n*(...)Golem should be presented to science oriented researchers and be recognized in voluntary computations. That would improve our userbase, it would contribute to non-profit organizations and, of course, would bring dApps to the non blockchain world. (...)

So, in short, the narrative ""the price does not matter"" would be neither politically nor logically correct. However, we need to look after the best interests of all users, either golem software users or token holders, that helped us kickstart this venture.*\n\n*(...)So, the GNT should be easy to use directly on the platform. Still, the token should also supplement the platform in other ways (e.g., through community-driven projects on the platform utilizing economic mechanisms envisioned and developed by the community members). The token should also be easy to use in a broader context (e.g., the DeFi), which may or may not result in a direct connection with the Golem platform.""*\n\n*""The current model with on-chain payments is not sustainable for Golem and other similar projects which need a trade-off between the cost of transaction, security/finality and timing. When it comes to small (aka micro) payments it’s even more important. It may happen that due to Ethereum congestion one has to pay more for the gas than the computations itself.*\n\n*Here comes the idea for moving payments to layer 2 solutions.

Right now, doing gassless transactions with the current GNT is cumbersome, and there are many solutions in the market that would be a great fit if GNT was ERC20.(...) As we continue the work &amp; research, we may come up with more ideas that go beyond this, but our main focus remains on giving our users the chance to improve their Golem experience, trade without KYC (if they want to) - while we simultaneously look into all the DeFi ecosystem, and see if we can have the chance of using the token in other platforms.""*\n\n**New Team Members and GolemGrid**\n\n*""Radek Tereszczuk has joined us in order to work on the long-term vision of the project and how it fits in the overall web 3 vision.

We have an internal chat for the team members, so if there’s any questions one can just type in there and receive an answer fairly quickly.*\n\n*No challenges to GolemGrid. Actually all more helpful since i\'ve got the smart developers around to answers questions about Golem if needed. (...)*\n\n*Currently there has not been any talk of GolemGrid integrating into Golem or something similar. So atm it’s purely separated as it always has been. I myself will always integrate what’s possible with Golem to GolemGrid, so whether that’s ML, Rendering or a third thing, I want to integrate it all when released.*\n\n*I have plans to fiddle with the Task API in the nearest time and see if I can create something unique and useful for others.""*\n\n**Events and upcoming Promo**\n\n*""Kubkon’s speaking at FOSSDEM 2020 in Belgium in a matter of days, then he’s heading towards ETHCC 2020 in Paris to spread the word about gWASM even further.The very eloquent Marcin Benke is speaking in April at EDCON.*\n\n*MP is also doing active reach out to conferences to help with programming and intro some Golem angles we’ve not presented before, and maybe more generalized knowledge that our team can share.We’re adding more conferences every month - and most importantly, we will focus on hackathons. You can rest assured that angle will be thoroughly covered, whether local or more international initiatives, we’ll have a lot of news on this front.""*\n\n*""We are working on our content schedule for 2020 (including regular blogposts as we’ve been doing), planning to add tutorial videos and workshops / hackathons. The planned marketing activities for the first two quarters of 2020 are going to be targeted towards quite technical people and they are going to be heavily tech oriented (tutorials, docs, hackathons, explanatory videos, workshops etc). The promo video was a representation of the more mainstream marketing that forms part of our long-term goal.""*\n\n**Tl;dr**\n\n*Golem has not adopted users as quickly as expected, however that goes for a lot of things in the cryptospace. The focus is currently on making the platform more robust and on UX instead of deep development and integrations. The Testnet API is live. Blenderapp can be run by anyone on the current testnet using* [*these instructions*](https://taskapi.docs.golem.network/#running-a-task-on-task-api)*. tutorialapp can be build and run locally using* [*these instructions ( NOTE: technical )*](https://taskapi.docs.golem.network/#building-the-tutorial-app)*.

As we continue the work &amp;amp; research, we may come up with more ideas that go beyond this, but our main focus remains on giving our users the chance to improve their Golem experience, trade without KYC (if they want to) - while we simultaneously look into all the DeFi ecosystem, and see if we can have the chance of using the token in other platforms.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Team Members and GolemGrid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Radek Tereszczuk has joined us in order to work on the long-term vision of the project and how it fits in the overall web 3 vision.  He is an inventor, expert and consultant in areas such as IT, telecommunications, statistics, machine learning, genetics and physics. After hours, research on the new class of programming languages \u200b\u200bbased on his own discoveries in graph mathematics. Has 20+ years professional experience in both his own start-ups and big enterprises (mainly banks and insurance), acting as dev / analyst / architect / project and product manager.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kuba Kucharski is joining us as Chief Product Engineering Officer to boost our product and engineering efforts. He has vast experience in leading developer teams and building product organisations. Involved in Blockchain space since 2013, some of his projects being OrisiOracles (smart contract framework built on top of Bitcoin and BitMessage) and Userfeeds (attention economy / blockchain explorer built on Ethereum).&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phillip from GolemGrid has officially joined the team as well, after his support on mainly Rocket Chat. (&lt;a href=""https://chat.golem.network""&gt;chat.golem.network&lt;/a&gt;). When asked about his product GolemGrid (&lt;a href=""https://golemgrid.com""&gt;golemgrid.com&lt;/a&gt;) and his working abroad, he said the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;So far so good. No issues with working remotely for what i’m currently doing. We have an internal chat for the team members, so if there’s any questions one can just type in there and receive an answer fairly quickly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No challenges to GolemGrid. Actually all more helpful since i&amp;#39;ve got the smart developers around to answers questions about Golem if needed. (...)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Currently there has not been any talk of GolemGrid integrating into Golem or something similar. So atm it’s purely separated as it always has been. I myself will always integrate what’s possible with Golem to GolemGrid, so whether that’s ML, Rendering or a third thing, I want to integrate it all when released.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have plans to fiddle with the Task API in the nearest time and see if I can create something unique and useful for others.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Events and upcoming Promo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Kubkon’s speaking at FOSSDEM 2020 in Belgium in a matter of days, then he’s heading towards ETHCC 2020 in Paris to spread the word about gWASM even further.The very eloquent Marcin Benke is speaking in April at EDCON.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MP is also doing active reach out to conferences to help with programming and intro some Golem angles we’ve not presented before, and maybe more generalized knowledge that our team can share.We’re adding more conferences every month - and most importantly, we will focus on hackathons. You can rest assured that angle will be thoroughly covered, whether local or more international initiatives, we’ll have a lot of news on this front.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;We are working on our content schedule for 2020 (including regular blogposts as we’ve been doing), planning to add tutorial videos and workshops / hackathons. The planned marketing activities for the first two quarters of 2020 are going to be targeted towards quite technical people and they are going to be heavily tech oriented (tutorials, docs, hackathons, explanatory videos, workshops etc). The promo video was a representation of the more mainstream marketing that forms part of our long-term goal.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Golem has not adopted users as quickly as expected, however that goes for a lot of things in the cryptospace. The focus is currently on making the platform more robust and on UX instead of deep development and integrations. The Testnet API is live. Blenderapp can be run by anyone on the current testnet using&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://taskapi.docs.golem.network/#running-a-task-on-task-api""&gt;&lt;em&gt;these instructions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. tutorialapp can be build and run locally using&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://taskapi.docs.golem.network/#building-the-tutorial-app""&gt;&lt;em&gt;these instructions ( NOTE: technical )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Other possible use-cases for Golem are BOINC and BOINC-like computations, however these require more effort currently and have been passed on for internal discussion. Several PoCs are being integrated;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;chemistry software for one of the scientific research projects from IChO  as well as gas-optimization calculations for gWASM and a PoC for a meta-usecase with tools for developers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The GNT should be easy to use directly on the platform. The current model with on-chain payments is not sustainable for Golem and other similar projects which need a trade-off between the cost of transaction, security/finality and timing. When it comes to small (aka micro) payments it’s even more important. Golem has not found a layer 2 solution that satisifies their needs. Golem has been working with&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=""https://ethworks.io/""&gt; &lt;em&gt;ETHWorks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;on finding the best approach for migrating GNT to ERC20. They chose to work with this particular company as our goal is to make sure that the passage to ERC20 allows the (new)GNT to be able to adapt to various matters.

They will also be speaking in April at EDCON, as well as doing active reach-outs to conferences to help with programming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See you all next AMA!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'GolemProject', 'subreddit_id': 't5_3emre', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/GolemProject', 'subreddit_subscribers': 20255, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'Summary Golem Factory AMA, January 22nd 2020!', 'total_awards_received': 0, 'ups': 19, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/esgkxa/summary_golem_factory_ama_january_22nd_2020/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': None, 'wls': None}]"|2020-01-23 12:34:45+00:00|t3_essh3p|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||||||||||||||||||||23_01_20|01_20|0.09889186|0.4752179|0.42589024|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.09181936085224152|0.2768768072128296|0.01671096496284008|0.2734857499599457|0.32773882150650024|0.01336834579706192

I created an account on the platform and attempted to withdraw his funds.
Made a couple of deposits as there are several requirements such as “I have to be a premium member of the website as I’m holding onto a huge amount of BTC, I need to deposit commission fee as the funds are from China, a prohibited country, I need to deposit half the amount of prohibited funds I hold” etc &amp; it came to a point where I stopped and questioned myself whether I’m scammed or fell into this Ponzi Scheme.

I’m clueless as the support system of the platform kept telling me it’s the last deposit I have to make before I can withdraw all the funds out. 

However, I come to term that it’s ridiculous for one to deposit money in order to withdraw, it was believable to the part where I had to pay a commission fee but afterwards, it just doesn’t make sense! 

Kindly advise if anyone heard of this platform, IVIBIT.COM before...

Launched in 2019 by three Stanford graduates, PI cryptocurrency quickly gained popularity among users.
Pi Network allows users to earn PI cryptocurrency from any mobile device. This is the result of cryptocurrency evolution in general. Bitcoin is starting to become old-fashioned as it requires a lot of electricity, while PI coins are completely eco-friendly. Pi Network uses Proof-of-Work algorithm without the high electricity costs.
Pi is officially known as a “social currency,” backed by everyday people.The basic idea is to get 100 million regular people to download the mobile app and be active miners, then Pi will have enough users backing it that it’ll become a legitimate cryptocurrency.

How to Mine PI Cryptocurrency?
To connect to the network, it is enough to have a mobile device based on iOS or Android. Then, follow these simple instructions:

Download the application on your smartphone using this link : 
minepi.com/alexpala94

Use the referral code ""alexpala94"" 
Specify the registration method: Facebook or phone number. It is recommended the second option since it is much safer.
Fill in the country of residence and phone number.
Fill in first name, last name and nickname.
After registration, each user receives 1 Pi per account. The system provides the following ranks:

Pioneer is the entry-level rank for all users. The production size is 0.39 π/h. You can increase it to 0.49 π/h if you participated in the referral program during registration;

Contributor. To receive this rank, mine cryptocurrency for three days;

Ambassador. A rank for users who invite other members to connect to the Pi Network.

Node. Members who have connected additional equipment to the network. This level is still under development and will be available later.

When you open the app you need to hit the ‘mine’ button. You do not need to keep the app open, just activate the button once in 24 hours and you’ll get the coins. 

Summary
So far Pi Network is just an experiment in the field of mobile mining. If the team will continue to develop the project, the app will become a real phenomenon in the crypto sphere.

My guess is not many. Of those that do have actual real-world products, how many have a minuscule marketcap of $22M? Number probably gets even smaller. 

The point I want to make is that IoTeX is arguably the most undervalued project in all of crypto. The fact that they have an award winning ([https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/iotex-wins-ces-innovation-award-for-ucam-private-blockchain-powered-security-camera-1028671560](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/iotex-wins-ces-innovation-award-for-ucam-private-blockchain-powered-security-camera-1028671560)) security camera that runs on the IoTeX network with even more secure hardware to follow at a $22M marketcap is insane.

If you're serious about supporting a project/team bloackchain that has a real use case and real products, then this is it. I encourage you to take a look at some additional details about Ucam here:

I looked at some of the available options and they only allow FIFO, LIFO, etc.

Essentially what I'd like to be able to do is adding my Ledger / SPV wallet with the following transactions:

Receive (in that order): A, B, C.

Spent (in that order): B, A, C.

So when I spend B I'd like to software to realize that it should use the cost-basis of the incoming transaction B, instead of using A (FIFO) or C (LIFO). Bonus points if that software is able to track my own transactions across multiple SPV wallets (so that it automatically forwards the cost-basis instead of me having to manually tag those transactions).

I looked at a few options (bitcoin.tax, cointracker, ...) and neither of them seems to support those features."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|960569|public|self|Bitcoin tax / coin tracking software that tracks cost-basis with specific identification|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/esuxyg/bitcoin_tax_coin_tracking_software_that_tracks/|all_ads|6|1579774974.0|||FOCUSED-DISCUSSION|||||||||||2020-01-23 15:52:54+00:00|t3_esuxyg|0|0|0.5||0||[]|False|False|[]||||||||||||||||||||||23_01_20|01_20|0.12868376|0.4246554|0.44666085|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.1379556953907013|0.35149896144866943|0.01769876293838024|0.2853624224662781|0.1942172795534134|0.013266895897686481

IoTeX recently released their award winning blockchain based security camera. I know IOTA has numerous big partnerships, but I haven't really seen anything they've produced on the level of this security camera, Ucam, that IoTeX has just developed. They also have other blockchain-based solutions in the pipeline.

With that said, how does one explain the value gap?

Marketcap comparison:

IOTA: $672,463,802

IOTEX: $22,322,529

It's easy to see which has more room to grow. If you haven't looked at IoTeX, I encourage you to do it now. It's one of the best kept secrets in crypto. There's no doubt that 2020 will be the year it takes off.

Can someone explain it in easier words why this is so 

His explanation  

This is counterintuitive: With 12.5% of the coinbase being donated, then on first glance, it would appear that BCH miners simply give up 12.5% of their rewards and would then lose 12.5% of their hash as well.However, after difficulty adjusts on BTC, it is a different story.

Assume round numbers for illustration: BTC is 97% hash and BCH 3%.If BCH gives up 12.5% of its reward, that 3% goes to about 2.6%, and BTC would go to 97.4%.

0.375% of the total SHA-256 rewards are being pulled out of the entire system, but this cost will be split between BTC and BCH in the same ratio as the hash (97:3).The BCH hashrate will be diminished by 12.5%, but BTC mining will bear 97% of the cost of the diminished profitability, because there will be more hash competing for the same BTC rewards."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|960484|public|self|BCH sharing plan - Jiang Zhuoer claims BTC will also bear the cost of their 12.5% plan . i cant understand how despite his example|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/esqf46/bch_sharing_plan_jiang_zhuoer_claims_btc_will/|all_ads|6|1579749481.0|MINING-STAKING|38a8ac5a-9d5c-11e5-a136-0e9f3a832fc3|MINING-STAKING|||||||||||2020-01-23 08:48:01+00:00|t3_esqf46|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||||||||||||||||||||23_01_20|01_20|0.12868376|0.4246554|0.44666085|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.1379556953907013|0.35149896144866943|0.01769876293838024|0.2853624224662781|0.1942172795534134|0.013266895897686481

I realized today I've been scammed more in precious metals transactions. Today I tried to sell 3 gold coins to a local shop. They tested them and told me they weren't pure gold and couldn't offer much.

That was weird, because I try to be really careful where I'm buying, and I've kept all my receipts. I went home, checked receipts from when these were purchased 3.5 years ago. And where did I get those 3 gold coins? The same shop that was now telling me they were bogus.

I brought the receipt and coins back to shop and confronted the owner with evidence. He said it's basically my word against his, that despite the receipt, I could have swapped the coins. Which I guess is true, a person could have done that, but certainly I didn't plan a petty heist over three years ago.

The compromise we struck is that he'd pay me the value I paid for the coins 3.5 yrs ago. That's higher than what he'd otherwise pay for impure gold, but much less than what I'd get were the coins pure/real, as I believed when I bought from him 3.5 yrs ago.

I've also made some dumb mistakes buying on eBay and getting bogus silver.  


But how often have I bought faulty bitcoin? Never.

How about imposter bitcoin? Nope.

Anything Peter Schiff complains about with crypto is at least as true with precious metals. Likely more so."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|960624|public|self|Crypto Full of Scammers?
