Recently started to dip my toes in the water with crypto and went with Coinbase as they appeared to be well recommended and simple. I've started with a £25 buy of BTC and ETH each, but have since found out that for some reason, Coinbase wont let me add a bank account. Rather than put up with the metaphorical fee rape coming my way if I were to use card, I've signed up to Binance who appear to actually want my business.

I am trying to transfer my £20(ish) worth of ETH into another wallet, but I'm being charged a networking fee of 0.006909... which is over 58% of the value. Am I missing something here? I thought I would be paying 0.5%: [https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/trading-rules-and-fees/fees](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/trading-rules-and-fees/fees)

My mom had worked for decades to be able to financially support us and get food on the table, seeing her struggle everyday made me want to be able to earn enough one day to be able to repay everything she has done for me and more. Since I turned 18 a few months ago, I got a job as a graphic designer, which helps me pay a few bills to help support her, but the salary I earn is not enough to actually make a dent in larger expenses such as loans and my eventual college fee, which forever felt as a inevitable looming cloud of gloom 

however, new ways to earn crypto such as reddit moons and brave's BAT could potentially change my life, enabling me to pay off my mom's debts and get into college, this enables a whole new ray of hope to shine through, and while I may not have any moons now, I'm just glad that I have an opportunity to get myself in a better place.

Additionally, what truly feels amazing is to think about all the people that crypto like moons can help get food on the table just like my mom did for me, to think that just a post or hell, even a meme could change a life, is absolutely wild, and seeing this community band together and support people in need, is really, really heartwarming.

I'm a 24 years old Iranian dude who lives with his girlfriend and has been struggling to make ends meet for quite some time now. Just to put things in perspective, when I say struggle to make ends meet, I don't mean it in a first world kind of way, I mean in the third world way. Meaning no red meat, chicken a few times a month and on the verge of homelessness.

So how did things get so bad? Well, the economy has always been bad in Iran, but ask anyone who has some ideas about it and they will tell you that the last couple of years are comparable to the last couple of years of the Weimer republic, meaning absolute inflation. I lost my job around a year and a half ago due to Covid, and things kinda went downhill from there.

I've battled depression before, but the despair I felt from being broke this past year was something else. Had a suicide attempt but thankfully (and obviously) it wasn't a success. I always knew that there was a way out of the black whole of depression before this, but financial woes are different. I honestly didn't see any way out. I saw people around me going broke not because they lost their jobs, but because of the inflation. Even if you have a good job and earn a great amount of money each month, it still won't be enough with the way the prices are rising. You either are a part of the %1, or poor. There is no middle class anymore in Iran.

I've been doing everything you can imagine to make some money. The thing about third world shitholes is, that due to the very low worth of their currency, you can make good money doing some very stupid things if they pay you in another currency (Like USD). For example, one of the things that I have been doing is boosting people in World of Warcraft and selling the gold for irl money (which is a big no-no in Blizzard's eyes, but I'm too poor to think about the morality of the situation and their feelings).

So why did I just type a random sob story? Well, for the past few months I've been dabbling in crypto. A bit of mining here and a bit of trading there. Made a nice amount of money, nothing to brag about but enough to boost my finances. But the main thing that Crypto gave me is Hope with a capital H. Although my country is still heading for ruin, and although I'm still worried every second of every minute about the future, I now know that there is still some way to save myself and my family from the hell that we're all plunging into. If I can get into Crypto deep enough to stop worrying about Rial (the currency of Iran), or at least deep enough to stop freaking out about Rial, I'm the happiest man in the world.

And none of this, none of this, NONE OF THIS would have been possible without you guys. I'm not a social person, I always lurk, never post. Not just in Reddit, but everywhere. I don't use social media; I don't use discord to make new friends. But you guys are different. You care. You care enough to help some stranger make a few bucks by providing all the the answers they might need and all the questions they might have. I don't know how many millionaires have been made from this place, but just know, even if I don't make it, I now have hope for the future.

Thank you for reading the ramblings of some rando. I wish you folks all the best and all the riches.   


P.S. This got way longer than I originally planned, but apparently I needed a release of some sorts.

I have quite a few credit cards I’ve made loads of cash back and rewards from! When used responsibly they can be a great financial tool. (Key word responsibly)

Anyways, I have been using blockfi for several months now and have been very pleased with the platform! Who doesn’t love some extra passive crypto.. anyways it got me to brainstorming how I might be able to juice up my blockfi interest payments without acquiring any significant additional risk. Most credit cards (granted you have good credit) off introductory interest free periods. I just signed up for one that is 0% APR for 15 months as well as 3 percent cash back on groceries.

Blockfi allows you to deposit USDC and GUSD and earn 8.6% apr compounded monthly on your stable coin deposits. The cool part is you can get paid that interest in BTC each month! 

So where does the “responsible” credit card leverage come into play?? I plan to buy all my groceries with this new credit card. As I purchase items I will deposit the exact cash value of the groceries into my blockfi account as USDC and continue to let the balance roll over each month. At the end of the 15 months 0% APR period I will simply use all the deposited USDC to pay off the balance entirely but will be left with the 8.6 percent equivalent in bitcoin as well as the 3 % cash back from the card I can use to buy more BTC The real risk here would be blockfi as a whole screwing me over but granted they are a trustworthy long sustaining/thriving business there’s no reason this shouldn’t work to get some extra crypto. Yes I know it isn’t crazy money but if you’re like me any and all extra BTC is welcomed!

By the end of the year Bitcoin will reach 100k a coin, and in the next 20 years it could easily hit 1,000,000 a pop.

I feel like this is possible, but my biggest issue it that the most powerful people in the world (AKA government) is generally against the wide institution of Bitcoin  as a viable way of the future. Changing that perception would certainly be necessary to a pro crypto future.

I live in Henderson, NV and am a 33 year old single parent to 2 (15/12) year old girls and went from rocking it, living comfortably to counting pennies some weeks, partially due to my daughter who has asthma and me being over paranoid. At the end of the day, I learned I was not financially prepared for this pandemic like I thought I’d be with my savings, and promised myself I would never make put my children through something like this again. Last week I reached out to my brother (who is amazing with money) for advice and he introduced me cryptocurrency. I bought $200 worth right away and he has my wallet and everything so I don’t touch it over painic. But I still wanted to learn as much as I could about it, and between 50+ videos and articles that I’ve read, you guys here have been such a breath of fresh air. I downloaded Reddit just to have a continued amount ok common ground of unbiased information after buying my coins (i have added more groups since then) and you guys are it. And your positivity and the fact that I’m pretty sure all of you want to get rich as much as you want the next guy to get rich and that’s very comforting and refreshing. When the dip happened these past few days, instead of panicking or driving my brother insane in my worries I just opened up my Reddit app and came here. I ended up calling my parents and asked if I could have my birthday present early (one that keeps on giving too), and ended up buying more. I have 250 coins now, probably won’t be able to buy more for while, But thank you! You guys rock, and I truly hope others who are new to Cryptocurrency are lucky enough to find you guys and your easy-no nonsense information. If you’re new here- take advantage of this. Good luck to all of you- and keep up the good work.

Other than a few transactions in the past that I've listed below you will enjoy.

Bought $300 worth of **Tron** in 2018 &amp; saved the password on my laptop. Laptop is in a landfill right now. :)

Bought $300 worth of **Bitcoin** in early 2015. Spent it online 1 month later. :)

Also have been holding **Ripple** after the great 2018 spike. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of the last 3 months I've vowed to never be a dumbass with my crypto like in the past soooo. I'm looking for some insight (or criticism) on my current buys. I like to diversify my portfolio so here's my current holdings and why.

**Ripple (XRP)** \- Cheap fees, possible future in banking, slapping the SEC's hands, very focused group. This is the reason why I'm still holding it. 

**Digibyte (DGB)** \- Cheap fees, fast transactions, high security, 

**Algorand (ALGO)** \- Fast speeds, Customizable contractors, Great APY for staking. Staking is safer and requires less energy than mining. Might have a minimal effect, but I think problems in the future going to occur due to the exponential increase of energy demand. If this were to occur, I believe staking will be more widely adopted. (Unsure the effect it has on inflation for the coin tho..)

**Stellar Lumens (XLM)** \- Cheap fees, Great partners. 

**Civic (CVC)** \- Identity verification. I see many instances where ID verification would be needed. (Real estate, firearms, medical, government departments, etc..)

**Storj (STORJ)** \- Allows users to lend out unused disk storage space to store encrypted and decentralized data. I see it kinda like storing your car but instead its broken into a million pieces in a million different storage units and only you can call all the pieces back together to make your car . Would work great for large companies like apple to cloud store all your photos, info, payment options, etc. BUT I COULD BE WRONG lol 

**District0x (DNT)** \- Bought it as a quick flip on Saturday nights (4/17/2021) correction because it had the biggest drop within that hour. I was expecting a large return within a week. Has gone up (30%) as it sits. so far so good."|False|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|2197766|public|self|Crypto-Portfolio..

A lot of your friends and peers were starting to ask you where they should invest in and you saw your profits gain by the day. 

Coins were emerging and we were using exchanges such as BTC-E, Poloniex, Bitfinex, Binance and so on. 

You and your friends would scavenge the internet to search for new interesting crypto. 

You would stumble upon Cryptogurus on youtube, Bitconnect poniz's and Tech giants which would have an opinion on certain things. 

At that time, we had the man, the myth, the legend John ""Cryptogod"" Mcafee which was calling out all these alt coins which would MOON within the same week. 

Just before he disappeared he convinced us one more time. Remember in 2017 when John Mcafee told us he would eat his d\*ck if BTC did not reach 500k in 3 years?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, guess what John ""Cryptogod"" Mcafee!!.... It is 2021 and I am still depressed, broke (super broke) and BTC is not even close to 500 k/ 

SO GUESS WHAT JOHN Mcafee, it is time to pay up!

Opinion #1: Doge is useless!

On the contrary, Doge is not useless. In fact, there are over [1200](https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/doge/) entities that accept Doge. A couple of the more high-profile ones are PornHub and the Dallas Mavericks. The calling cry of crypto enthusiasts everywhere is adoption, adoption, adoption. Well, Doge is being adopted faster that most other crypto projects.

Opinion #2: But what about that inflation rate? That can't be sustainable!

It's been well-documented and shout from the rooftops (or mom's basement) that Doge has a high inflation rate. This is true, as it is about 3.8% at the time of this writing, and projected to be around 1.8% by 2050. I argue that this is not a hindrance but in fact a [feature](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/dogecoin-has-an-inflationary-supply-trait-making-it-ideal-as-a-cryptocurrency/). Inflation is much aligned in these parts, but it serves a very important purpose when it comes to traditional currencies - spendability.

What do I mean by that? Well let's be blunt - regardless of how amazing your favorite crypto project's technology may be, deflationary tokenomics is the driving factor for much of the investment in this space. If the end game of cryptocurrency is for it to take the place of fiat, then people have to spend it. But who's gonna spend something that could be even more valuable in the future? This is where Doge's inflationary tokenomics gives it a boost.

ICOs and the markets for digital assets might seem like the next big thing, but a few basic, time-tested tips can serve you well before you make a decision to invest in any new product or market.  


* Only invest with money you can afford to lose. ICOs are speculative, and you can lose some or all of your investment.
* Practice diversification. This is the equivalent to the proverbial ""don't put all of your eggs in one basket."" Spreading your money across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate and other investments helps control risk.
* Check out the background and registration status of any individual recommending or selling an investment, including ICOs. You can do that quickly, easily and at no charge with FINRA's [BrokerCheck](http://brokercheck.finra.org/). Check the credentials of any promoters, salespeople, or those mentioned in a white paper: for example, if someone claims to have a PhD in computer science, verify that it is real using [these tips](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/avoid-fake-degree-burns-researching-academic-credentials) from the Federal Trade Commission.
* Collect and review information about ICOs from regulators and trusted media outlets. Study the company, including financial documents, executives and employees, organizational structure and business lines.
* Run the investment by others. In the case of ICOs, this might include someone with a strong technology or mathematics background, as well as an experienced investor, CPA or registered investment professional.
* New technologies and media buzz are often the recipe for the latest [pump-and-dump](https://www.finra.org/investors/anatomy-pump-and-dump) scheme. Look out for guarantees, unregistered products, claims of overly consistent returns, complex strategies, missing documentation, account discrepancies and pushy salespeople. All are red flags of potential fraud.

So I'm very new to crypto in general and made a big mistake today that is an absolute nightmare.

I bought £200 of BNB on my Binance using my card. All well and good.

I then withdrew said BNB (BEP20) to the LOT contract address instead of my wallet... I thought my phone had copied MY wallet address but obviously not, and the LOT contract was obviously copied to my clipboard.

I managed to get hold of one of the LOT devs and he was fantastic. He explained they never received it but found the transaction. It says 'Error encountered during transaction \[execution reverted\]' but they are not back in my Binance wallet. What would have happened to the BNB? Is it possible to retrieve? I know it's only £200 but it's a lot of money for me and I'm very upset if it's gone :( I've already contacted Binance and explained as I've explained here but what do you think my chances are here?

I'm not a big trader (I bought stuff with most of my BTC in 2017 like an ***IDIOT***), and it was more of an extremely long term gamble after hearing that coins such as these will be used for pretty much all tokenised assets in the future. The idea was to hold these coins for decades, in case they ever do become standardised and reach the heights BTC has.

I know it's literally impossible to predict but if stocks, commodities, real estate or even video game microtransactions use these do you think the prices will ever reach anything substantial? 

After the recent surge I'm thinking about buying 10x more once the price dips far enough.

I tried a few different ideas, ultimately settling on what is now crypto for the homeless ([www.cryptoforthehomeless.org](https://www.cryptoforthehomeless.org))

The idea was to deliver food to the homeless while crowdfunding online using crypto. The project itself was inspired because a few years ago, my wife broke her hand leaving us with a huge hospital bill after the surgery was done (uninsured at the time). The generosity of just a handful of people online helped us immensely with the bill (a few hundred dollars for those who are wondering). We were able to pay off the rest and recover financially but I was so grateful for the help. That got me thinking - first off, health care in America is truly horrible (lol), but crowdfunding could be a very powerful tool to reach people that normally wouldn't be able to utilize it. Since I went to school in Philly at the time, I saw a ton of homeless people to and from that location on a daily basis. I thought about it - what if these people could somehow benefit from online money like I did? 

I started out with a really basic website ([https://cryptohomeless.home.blog/](https://cryptohomeless.home.blog/)) and received just enough crypto (bitcoin cash to be specific from /r/btc) to buy a couple meals. The next day I went out and bought some food and delivered it to 2 people. I took a couple pictures of the food and one of the homeless people, but I ran into some obstacles on the internet. People were hugely skeptical because they didn't see receipts, and also both homeless people with the meal. I didn't even realize that it would be such an issue, but that was the main catalyst that got me to OVER-document everything. I started documenting exactly what the crypto was worth at the time of donation (based on coinmarketcap). I started taking pictures of all of the food that was bought, the receipts, and the homeless people holding the food AND a printed out flyer with the QR codes from the site. For the most part, this improved things.

&amp;#x200B;

Then came the people who started bringing up issues about the organization itself not being an official non-profit as well as skepticism about it being a scam. For a short while, I just kept going out and delivering food/posting pictures and continuing with the donations. I was actively searching for new people to add to the team, as it was pretty tough just doing it all by myself. Almost around the same time (about less than 1 year into the project) I was contacted by a web developer, and a Tax Attorney. They both offered their services for free because they liked what the project was about, and also were into crypto themselves. It was beyond serendipitous. I immediately accepted their help and got registered as a non-profit org AND updated the website to what it is today. Throughout this time, I also provided incentive to various redditors who were interested in volunteering their time to go out and hand out/deliver food - by reimbursing their documented trip with crypto. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although this project is just something small/for fun, I want to see what else could be done better. Should we do more than just food? Should there be a different incentive to hand out food? Are there any other specialists that I should add to the team that could contribute value?"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|2198978|public|self|CRYPTO FOR THE HOMELESS - It's been 2 years now - Also asking for some suggestions|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mu8nhp/crypto_for_the_homeless_its_been_2_years_now_also/|all_ads|6|1618841335.0|FOCUSED-DISCUSSION||FOCUSED-DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-04-19 19:38:55+00:00|t3_mu8nhp|0|10|0.78||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||19_04_21|04_21|0.11076456|0.4499968|0.43923864|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07071885466575623|0.20293867588043213|0.01466779038310051|0.2337827980518341|0.4597536027431488|0.018138350918889046

## THE FUTURE OF ALT BITCOINS

# THE FUTURE OF SALES IN THE SPORTING INDUSTRY WILL INCLUDE CRYPTOCURRENCY, ITS INEVITABLE.

# Dogecoin: The wild world of altcoin cryptocurrency trading

Dogecoin has reached a dizzying new all-time-high of 50 Billion dollars. That's crazy -- the world of cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin is exploding.  


#### CRYPTOCURRENCY RELIGIONS: WILL ALTCOINS SURVIVE? [Here is the story](https://dailyfintech.com/2020/02/04/cryptocurrency-religions-will-altcoins-survive/)

**ABOUT THIS ALT COIN:** **The United States has over 61 million people who hunt and fish and over 41 million of them did it last year.**

**eFishCoin is a member** **by invitation only cryptocurrency****.**  eFishCoin will offer a rewards and incentives program that includes Tag and Release [**fish tagging**](http://grayfishtagresearch.org/how-to-tag-a-fish/)**.** If YOU TAG or catch a fish with a eFishCoin tag please scan the QR code with your mobile phones camera.

Still kicking myself for not seeing the light earlier. My crypto portfolio has done far better than any stock I've ever invested in!

I've been slowly stacking sats and picking up other projects that look to have good long term prospects. I want to keep buying more, but honestly I've run out of capital... I had always heard about mining, but at this point it seemed like you needed a supercomputer to do anything worthwhile.

Long story short, I started Folding @ Home to get some **banano** rewards. I saw a couple posts on banano, and it peaked my interest since it seemed possible to get a meaningful amount of rewards with a normal computer. Folding @ Home is a programs that allows you to ""donate"" cpu/gpu power to do science and help fight disease. Although its kind of a shitcoin/memecoin, it seems to be more altruistic and less of a pure money grab than other meme projects.

Right now I'm only folding w/ the GPU, as my CPU was getting over 90C while folding. Regardless, I'm on track to get around 100 banano per day which is like $1.60. I'm probably losing $ w/ the cost of electricity and potential degradation of the laptop I'm using, but if banano sees another decent jump in price, it could be worth it. And if nothing else, maybe I contributed some good to the world by running these computations.

Also... I think it took me less time to get Folding@home setup than it did to write this post lol. 

Another easy way to get some crypto is the brave browser. I can't tell how many BAT (basic attention tokens) I will be getting, but my initial impressions of the browser are good. I'd rather not directly support google anyway. I hate ads with a passion... but if I can get paid from ads, its not as terrible.

✅The team is doxxed/publicly known

✅ Audit is done

&amp;#x200B;

FullSendCrypto Is a DeFi Protocol centered on two key areas within the project;

The Full Send Trading App will consist of our Open Source Decentralized Trading Platform, whereby trading algorithm developers can publish their trading bots on the platform and users can purchase access to unlock the Trading Bot of their choice, in the asset class or market of their preference. 

&amp;#x200B;

Profits will be split between the Trading Bot Developer who published, and the Liquidity Pool for the Full Send Token.

&amp;#x200B;

Other major implementations:

\- Learning platform for crypto-noobs

\- NFT shop

Another function they are working on is trying to partner with the real life NelkBoys, FullSend legit!

\- Incorporating FullSend store onto the App

\- Utilizing FullSendCrypto to make purchases on FullSend merch, app, website, etc…

&amp;#x200B;

FROM THEIR WHITE PAPER

&amp;#x200B;

The tokenomics currently;

TOTAL SUPPLY 1 000 000 000 000 000 

FOR FUTURE BURNS 50 000 000 000 000 

PRESALE ALLOCATION 604 651 162 790 698

1) RETURN TO HOLDERS: 5% is distributed to every wallet that holds Full Send on a percentage basis. WHY? This means the more Full Send tokens you hold the more you will receive! In theory, you are earning money just by holding. 

2) STABILIZER: 5% of each transaction automatically adds it to the liquidity pool. WHY? The liquidity pool will continuously increase, which leads to a higher price floor of Full Send. 5% liquidity helps stabilize the price. Therefore, if a big holder wanted to sell, it would not affect price as much as if there was no liquidity there. 

3) BURNS: 1% of each transaction travels to Asgard, a black hole - and are permanently removed from our circulation. Asgard is an inaccessible wallet that no one can enter. WHY? With fewer outstanding shares, the ratio of net income to shares becomes higher.

4) POSSIBILITY OF ADJUSTING TOKENOMICS: we hope in the future, with a collaboration with NelkBoys, we can provide Practical Utility by adjusting the Tokenomics of FullSendCrypto, to incorporate a redistribution fee towards a NelkBoys Foundation Charity Wallet. With this presented to them, with substantial funds, we believe a real partnership would be possible, and allow us to help their brand, and help our community and investors alike!

I highly recommend reading that post for a primer on the various scalability options available.\n\nBut with the ETHGlobal Scaling Ethereum summit currently ongoing, we have tons of news on rollups. It took a few days, but I finally managed to get through the key presentations. Definitely worth watching if you have a cool 7 hours to spare: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsksm\\_by7LQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsksm_by7LQ)\n\nOr, here are some highlights:\n\n**Matter Labs** [**announced details about zkPorter**](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf)**.** Essentially, this is a Validium-like solution - a ZK rollup architecture but data availability is off-chain. Where it improves on Validium is that the data availability committee is partially decentralized with its own proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. They haven\'t released details about the consensus mechanism yet, but we know there\'s slashing mechanisms involved and it\'s implied to be real proof-of-stake, not delegated-type like pretty much every non-ethereum L1. zkSync 2.0 uses a Volition-like architecture where developers and/or users can seamlessly choose between Rollup or zkPorter modes for their desired level of security vs fees trade-off.\n\nWhile you do compromise on security with zkPorter, **it still offers far superior scalability, decentralization and security characteristics than any alternate non-ethereum L1**. The worst case scenario is a super-majority 67% of zkPorter validators collude to freeze your funds - but it also freezes their own stake.\n\nI have one strong criticism for Matter Labs, though - their marketing here is tone-deaf, by dubiously antagonizing optimistic rollups. Like I mentioned above, what they should really do is aggressively market against alternate L1s. There\'s currently $250 billion+ misallocated into many of these ghost chains, and almost all of them don\'t hold a candle to a programmable ZK rollup in terms of scalability, security or decentralization, let alone all three. By adding zkPorter to the mix, we now have scalability that\'s completely impossible with L1s unless you centralize your validation to supercomputers like Solana is doing - at this point, it\'s no longer a decentralized, trustless network.\n\nOf course, Matter Labs is not alone - **StarkWare is building a similar solution for StarkNet**, where they will have a data availability consensus mechanism to add to Validium. However, StarkNet is only planning to get there in 2022, while zkSync 2.0 will potentially have the entire stack live on mainnet by late 2021. There\'s plenty of exciting progress for StarkNet before then, though. In May, we will have the StarkNet single-app rollups - what they call Planets - live on testnet. Once Planets are done, anyone will be able to release their own arbitrary code using the Cairo language, on their own single-app rollup. Where it gets interesting is Constellations, where it brings a multi-app rollup this is due to release in late 2021.\n\nOn the point of Validium data availability consensus mechanisms, it\'s important that data sharding (what was previously ""Phase 1"" and now due after The Merge) will bring massive data availability to L1. However, I can still see zkPorter/Validium being relevant to potentially accelerate low-value high-throughput applications like gaming or social networks (which are currently impossible using any blockchain tech) to the tune of millions of TPS.\n\n**Optimism and Arbitrum** both have their public release-candidate testnets out now. Optimism is taking a more conservative approach with guardrails and whitelists for contract deployment on mainnet. A common misconception is that ""Optimism is delayed till at least July"". In reality, they have been live on mainnet since January. As per their whitelist approach, we\'ll see Synthetix to gradually move more of their functionality over to L2 over the next couple of months, and I expect to see Uniswap V3, Maker Protocol and a handful of others join them there. The July timeline is for when Optimism turns off the whitelists and anyone will be able to deploy smart contracts. It\'s also important to note that this whitelist is for developers only - users can freely use Optimistic Ethereum. Meanwhile, Arbitrum\'s key advantages over Optimism are they have no such whitelists and their testnets and upcoming mainnet deployment will be open to all from day one. Arbitrum also supports BLS signature aggregation natively already - the same cryptographic innovation that makes &gt;120,000 validators possible on beacon chain today can also be used to dramatically improve batching and scalability. Of course, Optimism has the industry support at this time, but it\'ll be curious to see this space develop.\n\nOptimism\'s approach of aligning its clients with Geth should mean it\'s the most Ethereum-like environment of the bunch. They fully plan to implement L1 innovations like EIP-1559, statelessness to further enhance Optimistic Ethereum. Interestingly, ""zkEVM"" is in the works for Optimism. Though Karl (whose enthusiasm is forever infectious) doesn\'t go into details there - it is pretty clear the Optimism team is aware of the benefits of ZK rollups and fully plan to leverage the tech in the future in some form.\n\nFinally, Polygon is also working on both optimistic and ZK rollups, and other non-rollup solutions, though their roadmap remains pretty vague for now.\n\n**Summing up**: zkSync 2.0 may be stealing the show, but they need to prove their tech on testnet - which happens in May. We\'ll get a clearer picture then. Of course, Optimism is a force to be reckon with, and likely where most blue-chip DeFi projects will deploy first over the next 3 months or so. It\'s the closest to Ethereum L1, and for complex smart contracts that wish to maintain as close to like-for-like parallel deployments on L1 and L2 as Uniswap and Synthetix do, it\'s going to be the preferred option. Arbitrum could potentially be the first publicly available programmable rollup, and is still very closely aligned with L1 with the sweet benefits of BLS signature aggregation. StarkNet\'s tech is already proven with DeversiFi, dYdX and ImmutableX live on mainnet, and their methodical approach may prove pragmatic long-term. While zkSync 2.0 and StarkNet may diverge from L1 EVM more than Optimism, it also opens up potential benefits of L2-specific efficiency and scalability. I can totally see deployments for things like non-financial applications that skip L1 entirely and live purely on a ZK rollup and perhaps even on zkPorter/Validium. Indeed - this is what ImmutableX is doing.\n\nOverall, the Scalability Race continues to heat up. It is still early, and each of these players have their own sets of strengths and weaknesses.\n\nDespite all the noise around Dogecoin, BSC etc - this is the real narrative that is currently unfolding in the blockchain space that\'s going to have lasting impact on the industry for years to come. **On that note, it\'s very important to note that the rollups journey is just beginning, and it\'ll be a space that\'ll take several years to mature.** Make no mistake, though, this is the present and future of blockchain scalability.\n\nPS: I focused on rollups here and forgot to mention that Berlin is now live, with EIP-2929 mitigating a DoS attack vector. Miners may now choose to up the block gas limit mildly, maybe something like 12.5M (current) to 15M. I haven\'t heard any concrete discussions about this, though, maybe someone in the mining community can comment here?', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t think I would post an update a mere 2 weeks after the initial post: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjyvxz/ethereum_scalability_race_april_2021_update/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjyvxz/ethereum_scalability_race_april_2021_update/&lt;/a&gt;.

Though Karl (whose enthusiasm is forever infectious) doesn&amp;#39;t go into details there - it is pretty clear the Optimism team is aware of the benefits of ZK rollups and fully plan to leverage the tech in the future in some form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, Polygon is also working on both optimistic and ZK rollups, and other non-rollup solutions, though their roadmap remains pretty vague for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summing up&lt;/strong&gt;: zkSync 2.0 may be stealing the show, but they need to prove their tech on testnet - which happens in May. We&amp;#39;ll get a clearer picture then. Of course, Optimism is a force to be reckon with, and likely where most blue-chip DeFi projects will deploy first over the next 3 months or so. It&amp;#39;s the closest to Ethereum L1, and for complex smart contracts that wish to maintain as close to like-for-like parallel deployments on L1 and L2 as Uniswap and Synthetix do, it&amp;#39;s going to be the preferred option. Arbitrum could potentially be the first publicly available programmable rollup, and is still very closely aligned with L1 with the sweet benefits of BLS signature aggregation. StarkNet&amp;#39;s tech is already proven with DeversiFi, dYdX and ImmutableX live on mainnet, and their methodical approach may prove pragmatic long-term. While zkSync 2.0 and StarkNet may diverge from L1 EVM more than Optimism, it also opens up potential benefits of L2-specific efficiency and scalability. I can totally see deployments for things like non-financial applications that skip L1 entirely and live purely on a ZK rollup and perhaps even on zkPorter/Validium. Indeed - this is what ImmutableX is doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Scalability Race continues to heat up. It is still early, and each of these players have their own sets of strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all the noise around Dogecoin, BSC etc - this is the real narrative that is currently unfolding in the blockchain space that&amp;#39;s going to have lasting impact on the industry for years to come. &lt;strong&gt;On that note, it&amp;#39;s very important to note that the rollups journey is just beginning, and it&amp;#39;ll be a space that&amp;#39;ll take several years to mature.&lt;/strong&gt; Make no mistake, though, this is the present and future of blockchain scalability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: I focused on rollups here and forgot to mention that Berlin is now live, with EIP-2929 mitigating a DoS attack vector. Miners may now choose to up the block gas limit mildly, maybe something like 12.5M (current) to 15M. I haven&amp;#39;t heard any concrete discussions about this, though, maybe someone in the mining community can comment here?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'ethereum', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2zf9m', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/ethereum', 'subreddit_subscribers': 791720, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'Scalability Race - Update 2, Late April 2021', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 29, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mttr7b/scalability_race_update_2_late_april_2021/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]"|2021-04-19 07:50:36+00:00|t3_mtvoym|0|1|0.67||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]|/r/ethereum/comments/mttr7b/scalability_race_update_2_late_april_2021/|||||||||||||||||19_04_21|04_21|0.12710072|0.5120065|0.36089268|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07240058481693268|0.2270035296678543|0.01829255372285843|0.4567823112010956|0.21297985315322876|0.012541070580482483

I found SafeMoon and figured why not, it's so cheap. I bought in a decent size and started poking around. Their sub on Reddit of filled with 1 or 2 month user profiles, same with their Twitter. As they gain momentum more and more Twitter profiles are legitimate people.

When I started asking questions on their sub the fresh profiles respond with the usual ""SafeMoon is the best"". Then I found SafeEarth and SafeMars. You aren't allowed to type the word SafeMars in the title or comment of any posts you make. I asked about the similarities to the other cryptocurrencies and why you couldn't mention them and immediately recieved a poorly written weird chat message. The message read:

""Hope you have validate your wallet in other not to lose some coin in future when it hits bigger on SafeMoon.""

Not saying don't invest. If you have extra money this is definitely a great way to double it right now. I'm saying be careful.

Of course I could be wrong and I will kick myself in a month or two when I could have had billions. Best you can do is hope for the best but prepare for the worst.

Apologies if this is poorly written. I'm trying to finish it up before I go in for work. 

Good Luck everyone

I also know a lot of people are predicting Doge might go up to $1.

I personally think there is no way to accurately predict this especially after the recent drop that didn't effect Doge. Thus proving the only thing really effecting the price of Doge is hype and that's it.

So to get to my point I want to invest in Doge because of the potential money making opportunity but I'm just curious if people think it's worth it or too risky? Also I would like to know if anyone here is investing any substantial amounts into Doge (like 10% or more of your entire portfolio) or just small amounts?"|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|441706|public|self|Doge is it actually predictable?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/mubt2a/doge_is_it_actually_predictable/|all_ads|6|1618850078.0|discussion||Discussion|||||||||||2021-04-19 22:04:38+00:00|t3_mubt2a|0|0|0.5||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||19_04_21|04_21|0.06340579|0.49510497|0.44148928|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.08904828876256943|0.15009088814258575|0.0093326261267066|0.4671396017074585|0.2762399911880493|0.008148635737597942

It's probably my most complex trading algorithm yet, and I'm happy to share it with this community because you reacted so nicely to my other projects!

Here's quick overview of what the bot does:

1. Pulls and analyzes the last headline from the top 100 crypto news sites
2. Provide an overview on the most mentioned coin across all the headlines
3. Analyse the sentiment of each headline and categorises the output by coin
4. Places a Buy order if the compound sentiment is positive and the a coin is mentioned in multiple headlines
5. It works with any cryptocurrency available on Binance

Here are some considerations that I am planning address in the future:

1. I accidentally used Feedspospot's top 100 Bitcoin feeds, so the sources are a bit biased right now
2. During my testing the compound sentiment wasn't high enough and wouldn't place a lot of trades
3. It can probably make use of multiprocessing to increase performance

Anyway, here is the GitHub repo for the source code: [https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-News-Sentiment-Bot](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-News-Sentiment-Bot)

And if you want a step by step guide, I wrote one too:
