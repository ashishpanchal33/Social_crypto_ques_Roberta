A lot of people in society won’t blink an eyelid to get a loan for a car which can be stolen, crashed, damaged etc &amp; and the minute you take it out of the showroom and onto the road it loses value. Alot of people also get car loans for cars they don’t even need to have, they could spend half the amount of money and that car will still get you from point A to point B. 

However when it comes crypto so many people seem to think it’s stupid. Yes it’s stupid to bet on a meme coin or potential rug pull but what about a coin you believe in? 

If you think that bitcoin, ether, cardano, solana, enjin, ripple, algo etc aren’t having at least decent gains in the next few years then why are you here anyway? 

Understanding it’s definitely not for everyone just don’t understand why having a car loan is encouraged but for an investment is not.

1. https://www.algorand.com/technology
2. https://algorand.foundation/algorand-protocol/about-algorand-protocol
3. https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/what_is_blockchain/

One quick mention about the real deal founder of Algorand, Silvio Micali, who is a co-inventor of probabilistic encryption, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Verifiable Random Functions and many of the protocols that are the foundations of modern cryptography. He's an old man and to put it in plain terms, he founded the encryption methods used to protect all of the internet, for decades, and the same protocols used to secure all blockchains today. He's the Einstein of Relativity within Cryptography. And won the Turing award for transformative work that laid the complexity-theoretic foundations for the science of cryptography and in the process pioneered new methods for efficient verification of mathematical proofs in complexity theory.

He developed Algorand, as an academic challenge, since he was interested in the fact everybody in the space continually, for over 8 years, stated the blockchain trilemma was unsolvable.

What people dont understand about ALGO is that it is a voting utility for the blockchain ecosystem (Algorand). I know the name and symbol is lame, but I encourage everyone to mature past these eyesores.

Traditionally within this space the goals and ideas have circulated around developing and distributing a ""coin"" or ""currency"" that was decentralized. And that's a very good thing. When it comes to Algorand though, the intention is to distribute a decentralized voting platform and create an ecosystem where startups or new players may create/mint their own coins leveraging all the benefits of the chain directly. This is different than an ERC20 coin, because ERC20 is an off chain smart contract. Algorand facilitates the ability to create and issue new coins directly off the main chain. And also allows smart contracts to be written directly on the main layer (more of this can be read about in the links I provided above, but the benefits of this chains design are enormous).

Ok, so what does this mean and why should I care?

Using a voting coin is a different way of cracking the decentralized currency egg because Algorand cannot be forked. And it has a fixed supply because it is not ideal to issue a voting tool that may be saturated. You may think of the implications of this in your own time, but hopefully it is obvious.

This means that during the voting period changes to the base protocol may be voted upon. And because new coins can be minted on the mainnet - developers, startups, and new players may create, brand and issue their own coins without relying on the current value or mentioning of the ALGO itself.

Think about the problem like this &gt;&gt;&gt; if HTTPS is ETH and .COM addressed are ERC20... You create a website that leverages the security of HTTPS which incorporates additional steps and headache. The secure coin would be like going to a browser and typing ETH://USDC.COM)

Now think of HTTPS as Algorand. Minting a new coin on Algorand eliminates the need a of smart contract, or third steps and so the new coin would look like this, NEWCOIN:// or USDC:// (and not ALGO://USDC.COM)

Branding is important to companies and individuals and no other chain takes this into consideration at the base layer.

This unique feature also increases the storage of value with the ALGO because it is ultimately not intended as a currency, but a voting utility for protocol level changes. This incubates incentive to hold to not only execute the voting rights, but because it has a fixed supply. For this reason it has far more long term value than can be currently imagined.

As additional developers come into the Algorand ecosystem, and within blockchain development in-general, they will be able to tokenize their projects and establish their own rules all while leveraging the blockchain directly (no code to contract the existence of the coin, like an ERC20). It will exist directly on the chain, as apart of the chain. And this growing community will place more emphasis on which changes occur at the protocol level, meaning the value for the rights to participate in this voting will go -&gt; up ^^.

This feature also helps to protect the long term value of ALGO. If a bad player were to gain popularity within ETH's ecosystem, for example, and ended up tanking due to their bad decisions it would not only affect ETH's reputation but people would sell ETH in panic of the news causing unwanted dips in price. However, if the coin were it's own entity and that entity were revealed to have been a bad thing then that unique coin would tank and not the ALGO itself.

There is SO MUCH MORE to discuss when it comes to Algorand, but I haven't seen a post like this and wanted to share my thoughts and insights. I hope people find this useful. Make sure to checkout the links in the earlier part of this thread to learn more about this wonderful project!

**Staking** \- Staking is a means of earning a particular token, while also contributing to the Tokens Proof of Stake Network. Staking will typically require you stake (Lock up) a set amount of tokens in order to reap the block rewards.

**Liquidity Mining** \-  Liquidity Mining involves staking your tokens by locking them up on a given platform and in addition to being rewarded with block rewards you’ll also be rewarded with the platforms given token, (DOT, COMPUND, UNISWAP, CRO). However there are risks to Liquidity Mining and it is possible to take a loss. Always DYOR before investing.

**Yield Farming -** Yield Farming is a great low risk way that is very popular and easy to do on exchanges such as Coinbase, Coinbase Wallet, Binance, Gemini and Kraken. The best part of Yield Farming is that it does not require you to lock up your tokens in order to reap the rewards. Simply have a balance of said coin on your exchange wallet and a reward varying 0.5-16% will be deposited on a daily, weekly or monthly basis"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3797583|public|self|Staking Vs Liquidity Mining Vs Yield Farming.

I've been using the brave app for a quite a while now. Initially I switched to Brave because it offers an ad blocker built into the app. The BAT earning is nice too, even though you really don't get a lot. But there are several great features in Brave and you might not know all of them, so I decided to make this post.

1. The ad block is amazing. Brave filters a lot of ads and cookies. I for instance got rid of my YouTube app by deleting the apps user data and updates (you need to do this because you can't uninstall this app on android) and associated YouTube links with brave. Now I can browse the Web ad free and also watch any YouTube video without annoying ads.

2. There is an experimental option you can activate which let's you playback videos even when the app is not in focus and even when the display is turned off. Some might find this useful, for an audio book for instance. The YouTube app can't do that and any other video or audio will also be terminated when the app is not in focus.

3. You can decide how many brave approved ads you want to see per hour (right now it can be up to 10) to earn BAT coins. You can also decide not to spend those BAT to website providers. Every BAT earned will be kept in your app. If you reach 15 BAT you can transfer them to a wallet.

4. You can decide what Search engine you want to use. Brave also offers an independent self developed search engine. Google has a near-monopoly on search engines. The information billions of people look up is being served by a non-elected, profit-seeking monopoly. In many ways, they decide what is true. If you want to see unfiltered and independent results you can try the brave search engine.

5. It's a well made browser that isn't missing anything I could think of. It can locally store passwords for you, it's fast and reliable, it's maintained and updated regularly. 

And in the long term BAT could really have an impact in my opinion. It's stressful to surf the Web with so many ads today. Web providers think of ad space like an easy money source. They just put ad spaces all over the place and let Google show the visitors whatever they think will fit your profile. You often get to see stuff that would never be shown on any TV programm and some sites even include malware in their ads from time to time. BAT on the other hand rewards you for your attention, if you choose to see ads from time to time, which are far less in your face than all those Google ads.

What do you think about the app or BAT in general?"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3790473|public|self|Why I think Brave Browser and BAT is awesome|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qnoct1/why_i_think_brave_browser_and_bat_is_awesome/|all_ads|6|1636137834.0|PERSPECTIVE|||||||||||||2021-11-06 00:13:54+00:00|t3_qnoct1|0|6|0.88||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||06_11_21|11_21|0.09943512|0.50272423|0.39784065|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0823168158531189|0.11424129456281662|0.01224549487233162|0.49923110008239746|0.2819773554801941|0.009987949393689632

What did I do wrong??? I keep seed phrase in a hand written notebook that no one has ever seen besides me? Is there anything I can do? Am I belly up?

I think in order to make money with Crypto you have to invest a lot of money and not just $ 10 and/or buy something others have no idea that even exist.

What most of us don't know is the fact that only wealthy families have the resources to buy necessary equipment for mining, know right people with right informations or simply can trade with much higher risk factor (leverage 100x) others cant.

The fact that the media overlooks such critical details as this is very disturbing.

I've been using the brave app for a quite a while now. Initially I switched to Brave because it offers an ad blocker built into the app. The BAT earning is nice too, even though you really don't get a lot. But there are several great features in Brave and you might not know all of them, so I decided to make this post.

1. The ad block is amazing. Brave filters a lot of ads and cookies. I for instance got rid of my YouTube app by deleting the apps user data and updates (you need to do this because you can't uninstall this app on android) and associated YouTube links with brave. Now I can browse the Web ad free and also watch any YouTube video without annoying ads.

2. There is an experimental option you can activate which let's you playback videos even when the app is not in focus and even when the display is turned off. Some might find this useful, for an audio book for instance. The YouTube app can't do that and any other video or audio will also be terminated when the app is not in focus.

3. You can decide how many brave approved ads you want to see per hour (right now it can be up to 10) to earn BAT coins. You can also decide not to spend those BAT to website providers. Every BAT earned will be kept in your app. If you reach 15 BAT you can transfer them to a wallet.

4. You can decide what Search engine you want to use. Brave also offers an independent self developed search engine. Google has a near-monopoly on search engines. The information billions of people look up is being served by a non-elected, profit-seeking monopoly. In many ways, they decide what is true. If you want to see unfiltered and independent results you can try the brave search engine.

5. It's a well made browser that isn't missing anything I could think of. It can locally store passwords for you, it's fast and reliable, it's maintained and updated regularly. 

And in the long term BAT could really have an impact in my opinion. It's stressful to surf the Web with so many ads today. Web providers think of ad space like an easy money source. They just put ad spaces all over the place and let Google show the visitors whatever they think will fit your profile. You often get to see stuff that would never be shown on any TV programm and some sites even include malware in their ads from time to time. BAT on the other hand rewards you for your attention, if you choose to see ads from time to time, which are far less in your face than all those Google ads.

Apparantly the ETH i has was in smart Chain BNB network and i transfered it to coinbase which doesnt support Smart Chain i transfered it by copying my ETH wallet address.
In the Bscscan it shows that the transfer was succesful but it's been 12 hrs already and i havent received it yet.
I feel like i messed it up and the crypto is all gone.
I know it's only 100 bucks but i just wanna know if i can recover it or not.

With that being said we can start our lesson. I am your crypto big brother, a normal day trader back in the early days and a PROUD HODLER today. If you ask me Day trading vs HODLING, I will clearly say HODLING, but wait for the right price to enter the market(far from the ATH)

The next thing I want to talk about are Liquidity mining pools, ooooooooh boy. My parents used to tell me money doesn't grow on trees. But with liquid pools I discovered that they grow in crypto. Could you imagine being a tiny Binance taking all swap fees for a trading volumes higher that 50 million dollars? Well yes that is liquidity mining, you will earn a share of the pool by investing in it, when volumes grow your returns grow. So it's a win win long term hodling situation where you can generate passive income from your coins that you want to HODL for a long time(so you don't run into the permanent loss risk)

I'm curious what the sentiment is for fiat banks on the rise for revealing plans implementing Blockchain technology. These banks are bound to release coins of their own at this rate.

Maybe I'm just not understanding something fundamental to this equation, you tell me... But how would they fair? Isn't it counter to the whole purpose of crypto? Is it big finance trying to white knuckle a diverging asset class they can't control?

And this doesn't always work perfectly, but it is such an edge to this market that most traders do not see.

We are able to time some really big moves out of Bitcoin by doing some basic technical analysis on bitcoin dominance. And [BTC.D](https://www.tradingview.com/x/926xkxkA/) is currently nearing the end of a really step falling wedge, and we love wedges because they come to an apex.   
\*\*REMEMBER: Bitcoin Dominance does not tell us the direction of a big move, just preludes that a big move may be coming\*\*

So the next step is to look at the Bitcoin chart. [Bitcoin 1hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eRa5xj6B/) shows us that Bitcoin has been in a falling channel since it broke a new all time high. And this makes sense because Bitcoin has needed to cool off and reset funding rates.

Statistically speaking, both of those patterns should break higher, but they could also break lower and it's important to have a plan in place for all scenarios. So here are the 4 scenarios and how they each play out differently.

1. BTC.D and BTC both break higher : Bitcoin breaks higher from the falling channel, the bitcoin rally begins, and BTC.D is increasing because FOMO is driving new money into the market and Bitcoin is pumping like an altcoin
2. BTC.D and BTC both break lower : Bitcoin likely would pull back to the lower support of the falling channel and bulls would have to hope that support level holds. And because BTC.D breaks lower, most altcoin will remain stable, with few big gainers.
3. BTC.D breaks higher, BTC breaks lower : Bitcoin likely would pull back to the lower support of the falling channel and bulls would have to hope that support level holds. And because BTC.D breaks higher, all altcoins will get wrecked. When bitcoin goes down and bitcoin dominance goes up, there is blood is the streets.
4. BTC.D breaks lower, BTC breaks higher : This is a market euphoria scenario. Almost all coins are green, tons of double digit green altcoins. Almost no way to lose in this scenario unless you are late to the party and FOMO at the top.

But notice that there are only 2 charts here, and we can at least paint some pictures for possibilities. It's important to plan for each scenario because the last thing you want is to wake up in the morning, check your coins to realize your entire portfolio has dropped a zero, and hope that emotion-filled you is going to make the right choice in that moment.

He came with the idea of getting the control back to the mass by making an asset that is not controlled by the gov , but by the people with limited supply which people can use to send and receive the real world equivalent fiat value to oneanother without the intervention of the government which is a huge accomplishment , cause one of us(satoshi) took one step farther to take the control back and decentralize the money transferring system.

Thinking of how blockchain is stretching itself in the hands of great contract/solidity/dapp/blockchain developers to provide more real world usecases and get itself close to more sensible narrative in all the people's day-to-day life , there must be a solution to property and car ownership in that regard which would be extremely useful and again take back the control to a more decentralized people driven ecosystem that the power is in the hands of people , which in that case there seems to be an ongoing project working on this problem named futurent .

A blockchain based rental and trading platform for real states , cars and crypto assets that actually promises fractionalized ownership through nfts(in which fractionalized nfts are quite new developed thing made possible by futurent) which is quite a new concept if you think a bit .

Being able to earn passive income through owing a fraction of an asset (which you aren't able to do at the moment specially in case of more expensive luxury assets) makes making money much more affordable to those through royalties or renting profits to those whom aren't able to own a whole yacht , house , car to rent to someone which is quite practical .

If that hasn't still made you excited , if you dig a lil more deeper , futurent might have the key to mass adoption through making everyone in the world able to buy/sell/rent real world assets and offer a more affordable option for the poorer to own a fraction of an expensive asset by utilizing fractionalized nfts issued and pegged to that real world asset like real state or luxury cars , or even normal cars .

But anyways , we just gotta be happy that bitcoin and blockchain in general happened to be created as a  wake-up call for us to create a more efficient and decentralized system to our very modernized systems that still need to be worked on !"|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|640238|public|self|Is tokenization of real world assets able to create a more well-constructed economy with less corruption and more regulated essence ?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/qo76kw/is_tokenization_of_real_world_assets_able_to/|all_ads|6|1636206459.0|discussion|||||||||||||2021-11-06 19:17:39+00:00|t3_qo76kw|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||06_11_21|11_21|0.11373047|0.41845116|0.46781844|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.04209398850798607|0.06655336916446686|0.0036040658596903086|0.8177513480186462|0.06688778847455978|0.0031094748992472887
