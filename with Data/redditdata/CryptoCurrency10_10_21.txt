Seriously?

It's so freeing. Cryptocurrency helps me wake up each day even. I don't really look at the charts as much as when I first got into Crypto, but it gives me hope. I realize that the world is headed towards decentralized finance. From my perspective it's inevitable.

Investing now, you are going to be so ahead of the world in 10 years. Mark my words, in a decade we're gonna see CBDCs everywhere, Bitcoin will have hit a million or more and we'll all be laughing how we saw it coming.

The reality is, this revolution started before DeFi or Bitcoin. Back when the U.S. dollar was divorced from gold, it lost its value. 

Cryptocurrency is more than a way to secure financial freedom. It's an answer to a huge problem of money meaning absolutely nothing besides being controlled by institutions and greedy motherf*ckers.

Anyway, off my high horse. I love Crypto. I am excited for what's to come, even though there is going to be lots of regulation and FUD on the way there. It's SUPER important to have long-term goals in my opinion and stay true to them.

In particular I am going to look into Ethereum since it has the most direct comparison between PoW and PoS (for what I hope are obvious reasons)

Throughout this post I have many assumptions, but in general, I give PoW the best case assumption and PoS the worst case. You will see why towards the end.

Let's say you want to attack the Ethereum PoW chain. Let's say you buy one the brand new, state of the art antminer e9. They should run about $50,000 at most since they have a hash rate equivalent to 32 rtx 3080s which would cost you about $30,000 (plus a couple PSUs and 3-4 mining Motherboards). The E9 clocks in around 3GH/s

Note that buying other equipment like GPUs would likely be cheaper because for the antminer you are paying for the power efficiency, but we don't really care about that here since double spends only take short bursts of work to perform.

https://wattummanagement.com/bitmain-antminer-e9-asic/

Ethereum is currently at 715 TH/s, so starting from scratch you would need 715,000GH /3GH = 283,333 miners for a total cost of about $12b (and that would double ethereum's hash rate). If you bought any of the miners from existing miners or just reneged them, the cost would be much lower.

At that point, you could attack the network freely. I can get 1kw for $0.1, so someone with billions at their disposal should be able to get much better, but let's run with $0.1. let's say we want to do a double spend. So we send some Ethereum and 2 minutes later re-org and include a different transaction so it no longer happens. That should take only a few minutes worth of mining to achieve, but goes faster if you have more than 50%. Let's say doing so takes you 15 minutes.

That would consume 2556 watts /hour x .25 hour x 283,333 / 1000 w/kw * $.1/kwh = $18,105.

Basically nothing to actually attack the network. Even if we multiply this by 10, it is easily covered by the rounding on the $12B above.

So all in it would cost you $12b to attack the current PoW chain (maximum). And you should be able to do it for cheaper. And you can do it as many times as you want. If someone blocks your IP,  you can use another or a VPN. There is no way to identify if your miners are good or bad.

Now let's do PoS.

Let's say, in the BEST case scenario. You buy eth from people already staked. And you buying eth doesn't make the price move at all (unlikely). There is currently 7.9M eth staked, so getting to 50% would cost you 7.9M x 50% x $3550 = $14b

The hardware required to do so is negligible, so now let's attack the network. You try a double spend just like before and wait, what's that? The network didnt come to a consensus on finality? The minority chain saw you double spend and slashed all validators that agreed. You lost about $7b in the blink of an eye. The network has some issues for about 2 weeks until it comes back online good as new and your pockets about $7b lighter.

In order to have the possibility of successfully attacking you need a super majority of 66.7% to get past finality. So now let's buy 66.7%. now we are looking at a cost of $18.7B. keep in mind this is Ethereum bought assuming no price action at all and bought from validators currently in the network. (If you bought and wanted to get up to 66.7% from scratch outside the validator pool, you would be at $42b -still assuming price wouldn't increase from your buys)

With 66.7% of the network, you can get to finality. So you can spend, then double spend to your heart's content. Your first one is likely successful. Probably your next few as well if you did them soon enough. But the other validators can see this. Its a huge story and the entire crypto space knows it within about a day or two. Since your eth is tied into specific validators the existing good validators can easily just break off and ignore your validators. Slashing them for the double spend and then counting them as offline. It's trivial to do and doesn't require a code change of Ethereum itself (but would require a client update just ignoring specific validators from the consensus). So now you are essentially running a forked version of Ethereum. Everyone knows your chain isnt right, it had a double spend. So you lose half your eth again, but it's worse this time. Your validators actions are ignored by the network, so you can even withdraw half your eth like you potentially could have under a 51% attack. You lose everything.

TLDR / Summary

The cost to attack PoW would be $12b in the worst case scenario, but would likely cost much less than that (assuming you could buy existing hardware rather than brand new. Buying current operations has the effect of lowering the ""good"" network hashrate).

To attack PoS, at best it would cost you $18B, but likely it would cost you at least double to triple that since buying billions of eth would drive the price up and make it far more expensive for you to attack. Plus people staking aren't exactly selling their eth by in large, so you'd run into issues there.

PoS costs WAY more to attack than PoW and the cost will likely only go up as more validators join and the merge goes live

(Side note Bitcoin is currently at 148EH/s. An antminer s19 pro costs $10-12k and runs 110TH/s would cost you 148000000 / 110 x $12,000 = $16.15b to get to 50% hash rate from scratch)"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3570064|public|self|||PoW vs PoS cost of a double spend.

I prefer 2017 for its sim but 2013 for graphs. Just copy them into your google drive to edit.

**So one way people take profit is to DCA out as the market gets hot. But there are details, like when exactly do I wanna sell?**

There are many ways to do it, but the two ways I chose to look at were the [Rainbow Chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/) and 190 day SMA [envelope](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/envelope/?solution=43000502260). Trading view has indicators similar to the rainbow chart: [Bitcoin Logarithmic Curves](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/search/bitcoin%20logarithmic/). Some with bands that get closer to account for diminished returns.

Neither of these things are predictive. They're long term trend lines with bands set at percentages. And the higher the price gets from the trend line, the more likely it will crash.

Also, as market cap goes up volatility goes down so the highest peaks become increasingly difficult to reach.

**Google Sheet:**

What this google sheet does is to go through candlesticks from previous cycles to see how the strategy would have fared back then to hopefully give you insights. eg. sells when price is 100% above the rainbow chart's middle band.

The readme page shows things like, what percentage each band of the rainbow chart is set at. And similar things.

It's also worth thinking, how long did bitcoin spend in the highest bands? Is it enough time for me? **What margin of error do I want?**

Stuff to adjust include size of profit taking, amount of BTC to keep, and what level to start taking profit. And reinvest stuff.

**So what about alts?**

Common take profit methods I've heard of:

* When price 2x, 3x etc
* Based on alts' performance
* At round number points, eg $6k ETH
* Sell based on status of bitcoin (eg. rainbow chart, since the market mostly follows bitcoin)

I'll be making a post on alts in a day or two so stay tuned. I'm also posting small updates on r/leafypineglass so I don't spam main. It will be based on rainbow chart and envelope also.

Bitcoin noted close to 15% gains while some ALTS rally hard with crazy gains as much as + 50%, just to name a few: Harmony One, Fantom, Celer, etc.

The Top alts actually suffered some lost within +- 10% (ADA, Solana, BNB) but still at bay trying to keep pace with BTC. 

Now DOT! Polkadot, the 8th ranked alt, however, seemed to have gained some decent momentum. As DOT noted 6.5% daily and 13% weekly gains, trading around $35 during these times, once again speculations about the alt reaching its ATH rose. 

This time, as Polkadot comfortably sat above the crucial $33 resistance, the real question was whether these gains were market-driven. If not, then, can they sustain?

Amid high anticipation from DOT’s price and heightened hope that the network could announce the Polkadot parachain auctions in the coming weeks, DOT’s social volumes saw major spikes with Polkadot being a ‘project in trends’ on social media.

I am a college student and I am not working currently, all of the money that I invested was from my savings. This was all that I could afford to lose. I bought my first 100$ of BitCoin in May 2021 high and have been buying into different cryptocurrencies from then.  Until now I haven't sold a single dollar worth of my holdings. My main strategy for finding new coins is to just follow what some of the big YouTube channels like BitBoy, CryptosRUs, and AltCoinDalily suggest. My main goal, like everybody else, is to make some good amount of money. Yesterday, when I was going through my portfolio, I felt like I hold way too many coins but I couldn't figure out how to fix that. I was thinking of selling some of my low caps but come on, those are the only ones that truly have a 10x potential. Also, one thing that has been bugging my mind is that how bullish everyone is on XRP, everyone is like XRP is definitely going to 10-15$ after the Ripple case settles (BitBoy Crypto says it will top out at 22$). Should I just sell everything (or most of my holdings) and put it in XRP so I can go home with around a 60K-100K bag? I don't know man, everything is so confusing.

Anyways, guys, I would love to get some opinions on how I can make my portfolio better and also how to have more of an objective approach towards all this, every new coin I look at seems like the next big thing (and that makes me wanna put money into it). Also, some thoughts on my XRP plan would be highly appreciated.

Feel free to roast me and have fun. I am pretty chill and I am just here to learn.

So you too right? Right? I mean I have enough fiat to pay my bills but I'll be damned if I am going to get 1.5% from a bank on my money or even worse put that shit in a savings account... I am saving, just ask my cold storage. 

I don't actually have a back up plan if ALL my crypto ""investments"" went sideways and yes I am aware of the ""don't invest more than you can afford to lose"" advice but I don't see this with things like BTC and even ETH. Sure I have a wide variety of coins I hold. That being said 95% are short term and 100% as I eventually plan to parlay them into BTC and ETH. Am I alone in believing this is better than savings traditionally?

But the entry to participate in these launches is very high especially to third world people whose native currency is valued lot less compared to USD.

Me, being from India, 1000$ for investing in a token launch is a big amount of money unaffordable by 80% of citizens. But to get into these, I would need to have native tokens of these launchpads which eats up a lot of that amount. For e.g. Polkastarter need minimum 250 POLS which cost around 2$ and that sets me back by half the amount already. Even then it is just a lottery system which means the 500$ I put in is still a wild gamble coz the allocation is not guaranteed as well as the price might anytime plummet. Similar approach goes for other modes of public sale that is over allocation. For e.g. people who stake 15K USD worth tokens like BNB/ETH with get some 1K or 500USD worth allocations of the tokens (might get much less too).. which means I need to either have 15K worth assets or loan 15K worth of those assets (for which I need to deposit much higher value collateral) which is crazy lot money.

Whatever the method may be it only benefits the rich people who could easily afford these things. In other words these are the rich get more rich schemes.. Blockchain being decentralization focused, I don't see any fair value here.. So my questions are,

1. What are the other ways these launches are happening (apart from fair launches) in which retail and average pocket investors can get in?

However, self-governed of the amount being transferred, global scale blockchain-based cryptocurrencies suffer from high transaction waiting times and gas fees. These impediments prevent the global real use of cryptocurrencies by masses instead of the traditional mainstream payment processors such as Visa.   To address these challenges, Xpal Proof of Credit Channel Network is planning as the most workable solution to be used for micro-payments (for first step for int’l trade shows and art auctions). Xpal off-chain payment channel networks can provide instant transaction approvals in seconds by lowest fee through its share gas system. charging a nominal fee proportional to the payment amount. Such attraction on payment channel networks inspired many recent studies which focus on how to design them and allocate channels such that the transactions will be secure and efficient. However, as payment channel networks are emerging and reaching large number of users, privacy issues are becoming more relevant that raise concerns about exposing not only individual habits but also businesses’ revenues.|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3569007|public|self|||is PoC and SHARED GAS system is future payment and transferring solution for crypto world.?|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q54pzc/is_poc_and_shared_gas_system_is_future_payment/||all_ads|6|1633838013.0|||||||||||||2021-10-10 09:23:33+00:00|t3_q54pzc|0|1||

Putting the two together, has anyone done an experiment where they’ve somehow scraped data from this subreddit and then purchased the coins that have the greatest change in positive mentions from one month to another?

E.g if four months ago there had been 78 posts essentially saying ‘bullish on ONE’ and then three months back 873 posts saying ‘bullish on ONE’ they’d bought ONE and held for a set amount of time, before then selling and repeating the process after a set interval (e.g a quarter) and doing it with the next coin (for the sake of argument, let’s say we are now seeing lots of posts saying ‘bullish on CRO’ so, having seen out a quarter with ONE, they might then move this investment to CRO?

Of this 50 percent i have made a plan to invest half of it in crypto and half in the regular market. My salary isnt much, ( about $300 a month) but I have managed to wet my feet by having a bag of CELR , ADA and ETH. All of these  I came to know about from this sub! I did my research decided to put my money in these projects.
I am yet to make any profits though as I have consistently managed to buy into these at their peaks during the cycle. But that's a problem on my part. I am hoping I could get some further guidance from experienced people in the sub as to where to put my money in the coming months . Should I keep adding to these bags or if I should look for more diversity? All of this money means a lot to me as I wish to fund my further education by myself and would really like to buy a gaming computer too (but that can wait) . With my salary all of this is only possible If I get high gains and consistently keep reinvesting. So I would really like any and all fo your recommendations and a good time frame to but the crypto you are suggesting. Thanks a lot in advance to everyone who comes up to help!

Today, I want to talk about why Decentralised Social Media is (IMO) the next smart move, and the future for all users and content creators.

**Problems of Centralised Social Media**

* A handful of private companies effectively control public discourse, and earn monopoly profits off of content that they don't even create.
* The creators who actually produce this content are underpaid and under-engaged due to an outdated ads-driven business model.
* The ads-driven business model also forces social media companies to keep a walled garden around content created on their platforms, preventing external developers from innovating or building apps on top of it.

Don't get me wrong, there's surely value in combining all of the content into a single pool, since it allows for curation at a global scale, but whoever we put in charge of maintaining the pool is ultimately going to become a centralised gatekeeper like what we have today.

**So what's the Solution?**

Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown that dominant platforms can be built around open code and open data. And, the more open they are and the more people that build on top of them, the more value accrues to Bitcoin and Ethereum holders.

If this model can be extended to social media and to the outdated ads-driven business models, we could start putting social media content into a public blockchain, rather than giving it to a handful of private companies to monopolize. Publishers could contribute to a public data pool that nobody controls and that they'll never be dis-intermediated from. Thus we could move from a world in which data is a heavily guarded, privately-owned resource to one in which it is more like a globally accessible utility that anyone can build on.

**Fancy words - I want to know the Benefits!**

Sure. Social tokens, Social NFTs, and Social tipping could give creators unprecedented reach, and a more direct relationship with their followers. And as long as the Decentralised Social Media is open-source, everyone can contribute to its code. For example, think of a major creator who wants to start offering premium content in exchange for a monthly subscription. With an open-source code, all it takes is for one person on the internet to build this feature, and the entire ecosystem gets access to it instantly. The same goes for other features like an inbox where creators can be paid to repost content, or paid to answer messages from their followers. And this goes for other things like detecting harmful content or weeding out spam, where the best machine learning researchers in the world can build solutions, with access to the full firehose of data, without asking for permission, no matter where they are.

I have an idea for a cryptocurrency that I was hoping to get feedback/thoughts from you folks.

Idea's very simple: cryptocurrency that rewards users for transacting in it (and thus incentivizes use/adoption of itself).   
Similar concept in traditional finance - cashback and rewards on credit cards - has been widely adopted by most, if not all, card brands.

We have made a Proof of Concept - it's functional, here's a diagram that summarizes idea and adds some details on how it works.

More details are available on [website](https://www.vincentiv.net/) \- there's a working testnet and blockchain explorer that you can use to see it in action.

Questions for the community:

\- Would you consider using such crypto should it become available on exchanges?

**-Scalability**

Mina project (if it is legit) is really undervalued, with its unique algorithm it would theoretically be more scalable than other cryptocurrencies and its particular proof-of-stake consensus mechanism could be especially nice for Dapps who require staking.

**-Speed**

Let's face it, my first choice before Harmony was Etherium, but with the crazy gas prices from the recent ""gas wars"" I have no choice but to look for other options, but I am pleasantly surprised to come across Harmony as it has similarities to Etherium 2.0, especially in the form of ""Sharding Layer algorithm"" (to speed up), but in the case of Harmony at the main layer 1! This small change will make it lighter( in essence), I know it's not a big change for now but if they do it well and improve that advantage with more ""speed bust"" and an original way to make lower gas fees, I really think Harmony has a lot of potential for the speed.

I must have gotten this wrong.  Please someone confirm or deny this.  Also, please someone tell me why (if I’m right) this works.
1. Some sort of Harry Potter card like things that are tradeable like baseball cards but moveing and changing like Harry Potter pics.
2. Moments that have been prerecorded that make kind of a moment in time baseball card vs a player baseball card.
3. Some sort of designed thing that can be pieced together and then played in a game.
4. Avatar clothing and items that you can’t have in real life but your fake computer self can have.
5. Tickets to a show that your fake self can fake attend.  

So then if all of the above is true, (and believe me I know I could be very wrong) would the moneymaker be to weed through all the thousands of nft’s to find something that people think will be fun to play or hard to collect?

Please meet Andy -&gt; 🐵

Andy has been born today. He is 24 years old (weird, huh?). He has been given a job and he can receive a financial help in case of emergency. Andy makes $2k a month and he spends half of it on rent, food, gas, and this sub’s premium membership.

Andy has a dream. He wants to buy a house in 50 months. His dream house costs $50k (he never wanted much from life anyways, you can’t be mad, he was robbed of first 24 years of his life).

*Andy doesn’t know stocks or bonds. Andy only knows putting his money into his left sock, BTC and ETH. There are no other coins or currencies in his life, no other financial institutions.*

How would you manage Andy’s finances if you were him?

50% BTC and ETH, 50% into socks?

0/100% because he wants to wait for 50 months anyways so then buying a house with his savings is guaranteed?

Or 100% into crypto because you don’t believe in a world where two largest coins are not around in 50 weeks? 

One last rule. A shocking one… in Andy’s world, buying high selling low doesn’t make a profit."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3567186|public|self|||Newborn Andy dilemma|0|[]|0.46|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q4vjil/newborn_andy_dilemma/||all_ads|6|1633798648.0|87049662-0882-11e5-82e1-0e9d1a9f7761||||||||||||2021-10-09 22:27:28+00:00|t3_q4vjil|0|0||

I looked at several altcoins that have been talked about recently: XTZ, ALGO, HBAR, and SOL. The first 3 have all been talked about in positive lights only, while SOL has been criticized for being “centralized” and having an off switch that the devs used. 

In fact, SOL, does not have an off switch, the network was voted to halt and restart by the validator community after some nodes started crashing due to spam and a bug. No blockchain devs have ever had the capability to unilaterally halt a chain on any platform, which this sub should know. 

In terms of decentralization metrics like validator node count, ALGO has the most at around 1300, then SOL at around 1000, then XTZ at 400, and finally HBAR at 22. Clearly, this number shows that SOL is less centralized than other projects that are shilled here. Granted, SOL does also have a high cost of entry, but that number is exaggerated as well. A post recently went viral claiming that over 1 million dollars were needed to run a validator. The real number is less than 1/10th of that, and the post ignores that most validators get their SOL from outside stakers in the community, so most pay less to set up a validator on SOL than they would on another major chain like ETH. 

And this misinformation isn’t being corrected in the sub, either, it’s actually being propagated. I feel like it could all be fixed by people just checking something after they read it, or at least before they spread it to someone else. I also think that this is partly caused by the cults that form around different coins. When a “rival” coin is pumping, everyone else feels like they have to shit on it without even fact checking, and this is part of the reason why the community can’t be taken seriously."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3567089|public|self|||Everyone says DYOR, but no one actually does.|0|[]|0.73|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q4v1zo/everyone_says_dyor_but_no_one_actually_does/||all_ads|6|1633797028.0|87049662-0882-11e5-82e1-0e9d1a9f7761||||||||||||2021-10-09 22:00:28+00:00|t3_q4v1zo|0|36||

But what if that amount of money isn’t something you can retire from? Maybe you can close a piece of debt, buy a car or cash it out and live worry-free for a few years. You know the amount I am talking about? Not small, not huge.

With APY crypto has (in relation to banks) and multiple choices of debit cards using crypto as payment (like Binance, Crypto.com, Wirex, …) - it has become interesting to live (at least partially) out of yield revenue.

Is there someone who can share some tips and personal experience on this topic?

A world where money is of little importance in daily life and one could live more freely would be a utopia. However, for better or for worse, money and securing as much as you can like a squirrel to acorns is top of mind.

It’s why we do ridiculous things like farm for moons (👀), kiss our boss’s ass, and sell our Bussies for some extra cash.

When DOGE first started rocketing, and fervent fans started spamming “BUY”, there was a major sentiment change. Here a once beloved meme coin was seemingly getting hijacked by the most famous figures and annoying followers.

“Lol, they’re fools! This will explode in their face and they will blame Crypto and not themselves”

“This rugpull is going to be so delicious”

“Crash when”

“Honestly fuck DOGE and fuck Elon, he’s making a joke of Crypto!”

“You may have made a shit ton of money, but it’s a useless coin!”


I was one of those people. Many here were too. It doesn’t matter how shitty the coin is - if it strikes a nerve in the massive hive mind that is the internet - throw a bone at it once in a while.

Take a small chunk of earnings from another project and see what happens. If you lose half of it, you called it.

If you make some extra cake, the world is an unpredictable place.

**After a lot of requests, yesterday I added an option to get all the Moons transaction data I have!**

Some notes about the data:

* The file includes the fields: **date, amount, to\_name, from\_name, to\_addr, from\_addr, and hash**.
* ""to\_name"" and ""from\_name"" are Redditor usernames or other labels (see next bullet point). I can only tie usernames to addresses from the distribution CSVs the admins produce, so this will be blank if there's an address I haven't seen before
* When possible, I also label addresses such as the Moons faucet, the Burn/Mint address, MoonsDust distributions, and various exchanges.
* The full file is large, IIRC hundreds of thousands of rows. It is updated roughly once per hour
* Data quality is not guaranteed and is my best effort. Spot-checked a lot of times but it's possible some things are incorrect.

Please be conscious when voting - Your goal will likely increase once you've either met it or become close to meeting it, consider what your goal was/is when you began to dabble in Cryptocurrency, discuss!

My first experience with Cryptocurrency was around 11-12 years ago, I installed a basic miner application on my PC and left it to it. The result? Hundreds, perhaps thousands of BTC. Where is it all now? Gone, deleted, \*poof\*. Of course, back then BTC was very much undervalued and viewed as a black market asset, my portfolio barely broke $10. Swings and roundabouts though, the majority of early investors sold in the first major crash that was the apparent ""end"", none of us knowing what was around the corner, I probably would have sold back then, being a simple teenager trying to make an honest buck.

Key point - None of us know what is around the corner, this is what keeps me attached to the Crypto world!

My thoughts: US$1M and I'd be financially ""happy"", although a little bit more would be needed to comfortably retire. I think with the mortgage paid off and a steady pension pot would be more than sufficient for me.

I have an idea for a cryptocurrency that I was hoping to get feedback/thoughts from you folks.

Idea's very simple: cryptocurrency that rewards users for transacting in it (and thus incentivizes use/adoption of itself).   
Similar concept in traditional finance - cashback and rewards on credit cards - has been widely adopted by most, if not all, card brands.

We have made a Proof of Concept - it's functional, here's a diagram that summarizes idea and adds some details on how it works.

More details are available on the [website](https://vincentiv.net/) \- there's a working testnet and blockchain explorer that you can use to see it in action.

Questions for the community:

\- Thoughts / feedback on the idea?  
\- Would you consider using such crypto should it become available on exchanges?

Now we all know a little bit about charts and those Fibonaccis and retracements and black swan and white swan, fomo and fud, supply shock and on chain metrics. But all that just goes in the wind when the whales start selling and believe me you can never time their selling patterns perfectly.

But i have found a way of knowing when to know that its time to start taking profits. Its when your friends and your parents and the people near you start asking how to invest in Bitcoin or Cryptocurrencies. When people near you or the people you see everyday start talking about cryptos and when you see them investing their boomer and uninformed money into the crypto ecosystem, that is the time when you should start considering to take some profits on your investments.

The institutional and smart money that has come in over the pandemic is going to shift things majorly, ESPECIALLY as major countries begin to develop their CBDCs. 

I do think this is going to depend on the stance of the individual country you reside in, however.

Some CBDCs will be interoperable with other cryptos (most democratic nations), others will not (China and other insular countries). What China is effectively doing is cutting a majority of their citizens off from participating in the new world economy, while the connected and powerful do have access to this major source of wealth and connection. They will have an isolated CBDC that will be used as their primary currency, and it will likely be laborious and convoluted to transfer those funds to foreign or privately developed currencies. 

It works in the interest of countries with de facto dictators to have an isolated population - and to be able to track how all the money is moving in the economy. Just how China has its own version of the internet, it too will have its own version of the Blockchain ecosystem.

I unfortunately foresee a future in which African and Middle Eastern countries that have received most of their foreign-aid from China falling into this same sort of situation. They have immense political and financial pressure from China and may be forced into participating in their proprietary Blockchain ecosystem instead of one developed with the ideals of decentralization in finance.

DeFi vs CBDC-based CeFi is going to be the name of the game for the next decade or so as every country wakes up to the financial upheaval that's currently happening - it's going to be interesting to see what ideals countries decide to land on. All I know is that it's essential that DeFi is fully deployed before governments are able to come to a conclusion on how to regulate it. Even if it may not be a concern in your country, there are billions out there where it is. They deserve to be free from financial tyranny as much as you do.

**TL;DR:** China is financially isolating it's citizens by banning crypto just like how it cut off its citizens from unbiased information by limiting access to the wider internet. CBDCs are going to mark a change from decentralized Blockchain ecosystems to government-funded and controlled ecosystems. It's essential that DeFi projects be supported by both developers and adopters in order to mature it to a point where it can be immune from government intervention."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3566748|public|self|||CBDCs are going to change everything in the crypto market|3|[]|0.81|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q4tah4/cbdcs_are_going_to_change_everything_in_the/||all_ads|6|1633791326.0|||||||||||||2021-10-09 20:25:26+00:00|t3_q4tah4|0|11||
