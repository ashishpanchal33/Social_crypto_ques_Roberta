One of the coins that has been doing well the past couple of years is XLM (called Stellar Lumens after the non-profit organization behind this coin).

To understand Stellar Lumens potential
I have tried to take a dive into it and present my findings and conclusions to you:

History:
- XLM is a coin created by Jeb McCaleb and Joyce Kim in 2014, after McCaleb founded Ripple but left in disagreement.

- It was launched by the non-profit Stellar Development Foundation - SDF (Stellar.org). 

- one of SDF’s main goals is making money more fluid, markets more open, and people more empowered (source: stellar.org)

-by doing that they also want to provide financial services to the unbanked
 
Potential:
- most of us don’t want to hear, but XLM is still kinda XRP’s little sister. But that’s ok, cause in the end they can co-exist as they have different purposes. If Ripple’s lawsuit gets finalized, XLM’s future is clear as well (at least in the USA). And that’s a good thing!
- the potential of faster and cheaper money movement and providing financial services to billions of people that do not have access to financial services, is huge

Supply:
-  there are about 50 billion lumens, total, in existence (no more lumens will be created) - 50,001,806,811.60 to be accurate 
- circulating supply is 46% or roughly 23 billion coins 
- the other 53% are ‘owned’ by SDF. SDF will release the other 27 billion coins over the next years on the market 

Conclusion:
- besides earning some money, you invest in making this world a better and more fair place for people in developing countries. 
Isn’t that what it is all about😊
- potential risk on the XLM price is the huge amount of XLM still owned by its creators (SDF). The market has to absorb all these extra coins. This will impact the price (or at least the price growth).
-don’t expect prices of tens of dollars in the near future. $10 XLM is a market cap of $230 billion(!) at current circulating supply. 
- to reach the unbanked takes time. Especially earning trust from them takes time as they have been robbed, manipulated and outcasted by the traditional financial system since ever 

To sum up: just HODL people, the world isn’t changed in one day, it takes time! The potential is real, but it takes time and The rewards for enduring will be big.💪"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3260301|public|self|A dive into Stellar Lumens|1|[]|0.8|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/os7aj9/a_dive_into_stellar_lumens/|all_ads|6|1627311428.0|||||||||||||||||2021-07-26 20:27:08+00:00|t3_os7aj9|0|67||

Yesterday I was thinking about the next future bull run and I was also not completely sober. I thought ""I really wanna make sure I have as much as possible to buy the next dip or be ready for the run"" so i went for leverage day trading. Absolutely idiotic move and I will be completely honest so as to clear my conscience: I went 100x leverage with nearly a quarter of the value of my portfolio. I was looking at the market and I'd seen some scalping strategies for day trading so I put in a short order and would have sold had ethereum dropped only 5 dollars. I wanted a small quick gain, nothing major. Of course this is right when the first big green candle hit and I got almost immediately liquidated. 

I won't be day trading again and I might pick a more healthy activity than drinking and watching the markets. Maybe only social drinking from now on.

Hope it's informative.

# 1st Generation of Crypto - Bitcoin

As everyone knows, Bitcoin was the founding father of cryptocurrency and is considered the first generation of it.  It accomplished this by being the first to successfully maintain a decentralized blockchain-based economic model which has proved to be a good (although quite volatile) store of value over the years.  Due to its enormous success, there are many other coins and projects which sought to duplicate and even improve upon Bitcoin which can also be considered first generation crytpcurrencies (Litecoin and Dogecoin for example.)  The main traits of these 1st gen coins are their simple ledger ability and proof-of-work consensus method.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2nd Generation - Ethereum

The next generation of cryptocurrencies arrived with Ethereum.  This project introduced a game changer in the form of smart contracts which brought programmability to blockchain tech and a new standard for tokens called ERC20.  ERC20 enabled the creation of an entire ecosystem of other coins and the ICO explosion followed quickly after.  The enhanced abilities of smart contracts have become the defining characteristic of this generation of cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

# 3rd Generation - Cardano, Polkadot, etc

This current generation of crypto is characterized by advancements in the abilities of smart contracts and an introduction to a new type of consensus method called proof-of-stake which offer a more energy efficient solution and enables a reward system for token holders.  Proof-of-stake and its numerous variants have since become the most popular consensus type for new cryptocurrency projects.  Even Ethereum will be moving to PoS when it's 2.0 version launches.

&amp;#x200B;

# 4th Generation...

Are we there yet?  Not quite, but we are beginning to see some elements of this generation start to emerge.  The most noticeable ones being NFT technology which has made a big splash this year through art sales and sports collectables.  However, that is just the first peek at what the next generation could bring.  There are still many issues in blockchain tech left to address such as speed, scalability, privacy, and cross-chain operation as well as a whole universe of new ideas popping up (like combining blockchain with AI.)

I started a discussion a couple of months ago, where obviously I was downvoted, about the **Amazon Managed Blockchain** [click here](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/). I was going through a AWS certification and there was a section about the AWS AMB, that's how I ended up there.

If you’re up at your goal or an emergency came up, I get it.

However, I’m wondering if a lot of the sell pressure comes from people who are so much more quick to sell because they either don’t believe in the fundamentals or some other reason.

Think of it like this - you aren’t so quick to buy things with fiat just because inflation is (especially lately) so volatile and currently on the rise. Offloading fiat is akin to offloading your crypto.

Here's the absolute minimum you should do to get started.

**1.** **Purchase a hardware wallet** (e.g. [Trezor,](https://trezor.io/) [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)) from their website or an authorized retail site.

**2.** **Set up your hardware wallet** utilizing your wallet's documentation (e.g. [Trezor Doc](https://wiki.trezor.io/Getting_started_in_5_steps), [Ledger Doc](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006395233-Take-your-first-steps)). When you set up your wallet, it should give you a 12-24 word phrase. Write this 12-24 word phrase on a piece of paper in the exact order it tells you.

Do NOT record this phrase on a device connected to the internet (computer or phone). Do NOT lose this phrase. Do NOT share this phrase with anyone.

*Note: This is your* [*seed*](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/what-is-a-bitcoin-seed) *(also known as seed phrase, recovery phrase, wallet back up, etc.). It can be used to recover your bitcoin in the event your wallet device malfunctions or breaks.* *The order of the words matter.*

**3.** **Check if you wrote down your seed correctly**. Some hardware wallets have a seed verifier that will check if your seed matches to your wallet ([Trezor](https://wiki.trezor.io/User_manual:Dry-run_recovery), [Ledger](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007223753-Recovery-Check)). Run it and check (if applicable). If your wallet does not have this, move on. We'll check it another way.

We're going to [make sure your wallet works correctly](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/the-3-things-you-must-do-before-safely-using-a-new-bitcoin-wallet) before sending all of your bitcoin to it.

**4.** **Set up your wallet to receive its first bitcoin transaction** ([Trezor Doc](https://wiki.trezor.io/User_manual:Receiving_payments) , [Ledger Doc](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006444193)). Your wallet software should give you a long combination of numbers and letters. It should start with a 1, 3, or bc1. 

*Note: This is known as your receiving address in which you can send your bitcoin to (like an email or mailing address)*

**5.** **Send a SMALL amount** (you're willing to lose) to your wallet. Copy and paste the receiving address from your wallet into the ""sending"" or “withdrawal” address field from your exchange. Set your small amount and send.

**6.** **Check your wallet balance** to see if your transaction was successful and the amount you sent to your wallet was received (it should be slightly less due to fees). It might take some time to go through, so be patient. You should be able to see the incoming transaction in your wallet.

**7.** **Wipe, reset, and erase your wallet** ([Trezor Doc](https://wiki.trezor.io/User_manual:Wiping_the_Trezor_device), [Ledger Doc](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017582434-Reset-to-factory-settings)). We're going to test your seed and recover your wallet (because it'll suck if you're recovering your wallet for the first time in the future, with all your coins on it, and it doesn't work).

**8.** **Recover your wallet** ([Trezor Doc](https://wiki.trezor.io/User_manual:Recovery), [Ledger Doc](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005434914)). Confirm your bitcoin and balance is still there. If so, you now have a wallet that you're confident that works and can recover.

**9.** **Send the amount back** to the exchange or old wallet. Confirm the balance on the exchange/old wallet. This shows you can successfully send and receive from your new wallet. Ensure you have your seed then feel free to send the rest of your bitcoin to your new wallet.

**10.** **Ensure you can find and read your seed in the future**. Consider the following:

* Make copies (one or more) of your seed. You don't want to lose your only copy.
* [Use a passphrase](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/what-is-a-bip39-passphrase).
* Make sure whatever you [wrote your seed](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/best-way-to-store-your-seed-phrase) on [will last a long time](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/bitcoin-recovery-seed-preservation) or consider writing your seed on a durable material.
* [Memorize your seed](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/memorizing-a-bitcoin-wallet-mnemonic-seed-phrase) (optional)
* [Hide your seed and copies](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/where-to-store-your-seed-phrase). It should be easy to remember and access, but mentally difficult to find (don't bury it 8 ft in the ground. How are you going to get it if you need it immediately?). You also don't want to hide it in an [obvious hiding place](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/hiding-your-bitcoin-wallet-seed-phrase).

There is good news that is anticipated with the Ripple hearing on Wednesday, as the deposition of former SEC chair William Hinman was ordered by Judge Netburn not too long ago. The thing about news and XRP is that regardless of good news, it continued to drop like a rock during the bear market (which is to be expected since it’s a bear market). But now that we’ve been in this bull market for quite some time, I’ve noticed something quite interesting with its relationship with ETH: that whenever Ether breaks above a new ATH, XRP outpaces its gains afterwards; therefore, if you believe that ETH will break above its last ATH of 4.2k, then this is something you ought to consider.

Because now we have something technically really juicy going on where the markets seem like they’re recovering, but there is also an important news event that is also anticipated only a few days after the SEC v Ripple hearing. Gary Gensler is expected to respond to Elizabeth Warren’s request for more regulations regarding the crypto space. This is somewhat concerning until you pair the timing with Hester Pierce’s and Elad Roismann’s statements regarding fair notice in the Ripple case.

Amazon did denied of accepting payment in bitcoin and creating a new coin.


FACTS:

However,  Amazon did said the following
“Notwithstanding our interest in the space, the speculation that has ensued around our specific plans for cryptocurrencies is not true. We remain focused on exploring what this could look like for customers shopping on Amazon,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

Also, Amazon did posted a job vacancy stating
seeking a “digital currency and blockchain product lead

Rumors:


Amazon to accept bitcoin and create own currency

Hence, it is still a great win for crypto adoption knowing the biggest retail giantis getting serious about crypto.

Personally,  I don't have any sympathy who believed in the rumour and jumped into the pump for short term gains. I do enjoyed the shorts gets luquidated which I pedsonalky think the reson thenpump happened in first place.

In layman's terms, BTC hit the same 'support' level around 29,500'ish on 6/22 and 7/20. This our base and 0% level. The high between these two points was established around 36,200 on 6/29. This functions as the 100% level. From here we can draw Fibnoacci extensions which are arithmetic percentages that reflect Fibonacci ratios. These are used largely by traders to identify significant price levels and for choosing targets. Today we basically hit the 161 extension (a very popular level used by traders) around 40k+. On this bullish breakout, I am personally interested in both the 261 extension around 48,500 and 423 extension around 60k. 

tl;dr BTC is quite bullish at the moment. We've established support around 29/30k multiple times showing market strength.

Never buy anything because they say it. Look into coins further after hearing about them on youtube before you buy.

· Cryptos R Us: George runs this channel and does two streams a day, DCA and HODL are his biggest arguing points. He goes over most daily cypto news and trys to argue against most FUD but he doesn’t scream buy buy buy, instead he brings up a lot of the BTC fear index and looking for OTC bitcoin deals as of late. He hates shit coins but open to looking and talking about most low to mid cap coins. He has a website with the same name that you can read if you don’t like his videos. I watch most days but his TA is not the best

· Crypto Banter: Ran and Sheldon run this channel (Fred the editor chimes in from time to time.) they have 2 shows Mon-Fri. the early show is more TA and charting with Sheldon who while being very bullish also knows when to set up a lot of good stop losses and profit taking points. He is also good at breaking up a portfolio and moving your profits so you don’t just hold through a pump and miss out on all the gains. He does take a back seat to Ran during most of the shows it seems unfortunately. Ran is very bullish on almost all crypto and seems a bit reckless but he does have a lot of info on every crypto he talks about so he can be very informative if you can ignore some of the random coins he brings up. They have a lot of guests come on also for interviews or “Banter” over a certain topic. They do a few give aways but I ignore most give aways that aren’t moons or coinbase videos.

· Coin bureau: Guy (yes his name is guy) runs this channel and he seems to be a General cypto Teacher/explainer/guru? Idk the term fight me. He gives overall review on many different cryptos, exchanges and just about anything crypto related. He is the only one I know without ads on his videos and while I cant promise he seems to do his best to remain impartial in his videos and let you come to your own conclusion. He does 1 video a day and Mondays is a overall review of the week before. This is my top choice.

· Benjamin Cowen: he seems to be the best TA I can find. He doesn’t shill and only looks at data. But I just get so bored watching him. (Note I admit he is good I just don’t like him. Don’t jump me)

· Bit Boy: he will shill and pump whatever comes across his desk. This does mean he is right some times but he promotes so many coins that seem terrible to me and he also just has a annoying attitude. Many coins he covers do pump so you can make money I guess following him but I dot recommend him.

· Altcoins Daily: Run by Twin brothers (didn’t know this till they came on to Cryptos R Us. They do a good job of hitting all the big BTC news and break every part of a video into 2-3 min chunks you can skip through. Decent info but very bad Clickbait titles and they don’t seem to have a lot better then others here.

· Techlead: Run by a Tool whos couldn’t hold a job at square or facebook but he is good at talking so his channel is going good. His crypto knowledge is very very lacking but he is a shill master with Million coin. If you got in early with that good luck. The rest of you beware.

· Richard heart: Know scammer Richard J. Schuler trys to hide his name and promote a Ponzi called Hex. It can be Rugged if he felt like it and he has already mad millions of of its original sale.

I'm hoping through this miniseries, I can stop *at least* one person from losing all their money. And HOLY COW, did [someone just lose a ton of money recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oip4mi/if_you_want_to_join_me_in_watching_metamask/). However, not to be callous: how /u/007happyguy lost his crypto could have been easily prevented. **This was not a MetaMask hack. This was completely user error.**

These tips are not 100% foolproof. However, they will stop you from being one of the 99% that lose their crypto to scammers and bots.

&amp;#x200B;

**#1: NEVER give out your seed phrase**

Every person in crypto would be better off having this tattooed to their wrist. It's that important. It is by far **the easiest and most common way to be scammed.** Big takeaways about your seed phrase:

* It is not a group of random words that Metamask or Yoroi asks you to keep handy so that you can re-enable access to your wallet. Your seed phrase **IS** your wallet!
* Giving someone your seed phrase is like giving someone your bank account.
* Unlike your bank, there is no fraud protection if someone takes your seed phrase. They have 100% autonomy over your digital funds.
* Assume that anyone who knows your seed phrase **WILL** take your money later in the future. Treat friends and family like strangers. If you give your seed to anybody else, **your risk grows exponentially** until it eventually reaches a malicious party. This does not include seed sharing services like [Trezor's Shamir Backup](https://trezor.io/shamir/). However, I haven't done much research onto the topic. Use services like this at your own risk.

&amp;#x200B;

**#2. NEVER respond to strangers DM/Direct Messaging you**

This problem is already bad enough on reddit. However, it only gets worse the more you get involved on Reddit, Discord and GroupMe crypto communities. This issue is so bad that subreddits like /r/MetaMask talk about DM scams in its first 3 rules.

Reputable defi apps and companies **should never need your seed phrase**. Any company or ""company"" spokesperson that asks for sensitive wallet information is bad news. Every service you use should have official support channels. Be mindful of the ""Nigerian Prince"" scams that haunt the elderly. Crypto DM scams are essentially the same.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**#3. Double check URL links and mobile apps**

This is commonly known as a **phishing scam**. Be aware of any links that you click. Websites that look like [reddit.com](https://google.com) could take you to somewhere completely different. You can hover over hyperlinks to see where a website will redirect you.

If you're unsure of what link or app to trust, here's some key take-aways:

* Look at user or download counts, where applicable. Generally speaking, a MetaMask on the app store with +1M downloads is more reputable than one with 10.
* Visit the official Reddit or Discord communities. There should be links to the official channels written by the developers.
* This goes along with Tip #4. Searching ""How to use \[\_\_\_\_\]"" on Google more than likely will take you to an official dev blog post or Reddit thread with the correct links.

&amp;#x200B;

**#4. Double check transaction addresses (and keep yourself virus-free)**

Sending your crypto to the wrong address is something I would never want to experience. As easy as it is to mistype an address, it's even easier to lose your crypto to something like a **clipboard virus** that replaces your address with the virus writer's own address. Here's a [link to a reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/comments/o1bmac/why_when_i_copy_my_address_does_it_paste_a/) showing the virus in action.

Viruses are rampant nowadays and are sometimes **undetectable**. There are ways, however, to mitigate your risk.

* Avoid using sketchy websites and apps. Refer to Rule #3 and #5.
* Double check transaction addresses before you send crypto.
* Use anti-virus programs, like MalwareBytes, and have it actively scan for threats.
* If possible, use a separate device for crypto and day-to-day computing. Not using your crypto device for web browsing will reduce the risk of being infected by malware.

If you find that you are infected with a virus, there are steps you can take to safely transfer your crypto. We'll go into this in our next mini-series: **Common Scams and Viruses**.

&amp;#x200B;

**#5. Do Your Own Research (DYOR)**

Easier said than done. Knowing what's reputable and safe is an art. If you've ever used the internet in the early 2000s, you probably have already been exposed to fake song downloads and mouse cursor programs that are actually malware.

Be objective in your research. If a liquidity pool is offering 42069% APY on your crypto, there's an extremely high probability you will be swindled out of your money. Luckily, there are a ton of great communities out there that regularly audit and recommend good projects. I'm sure others can recommend more.

Bitcoin hits $40K after a 6-week absence, but on-chain activity is 'somewhat bearish'

Bitcoin (BTC) touched $40,370 on July 26 as a solid day of gains saw the return of a major price milestone. 

BTC price daily gains near 20%

Data from TradingView showed BTC/USD touching $40,400 before consolidating nearby later on Monday.

The pair had held on to previous gains from the night before throughout the day, circling $38,000 before another surge took hold after the Wall St. open.

Amid some understandable excitement from investors who had waited for upside to finally resume, contributor Michaël van de Poppe cautioned on being overly bullish at current levels.

""Bitcoin still showing strength, although sentiment is getting euphoric again while approaching the range resistance,"" he wrote just before $40,000 hit.

""The trend has shifted, as the market has created a higher high. I think we're still looking at an HL at $34.5-36K in the coming weeks unless breaking $41K.""
That would mark an exit from a long-established trading range which has been in place for over two months. 

A look at support and resistance levels on major exchange Binance at the time of writing showed relatively little buyer activity above $36,000, with $41,000 still in place for sellers.

Material Indicators, which provides the Binance data, added that moving averages were important to consider when attempting to understand current movements.

""Quiet"" on-chain activity may dampen bulls

While Monday's gains were impressive, Van de Poppe was not alone in calling for a pragmatic appraisal of the Bitcoin market at large.

In the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, ""The Week On-chain,"" data analytics firm Glassnode likewise highlighted the need for on-chain activity to catch up with price performance in order to sustain the market.

""Overall, on-chain activity remains somewhat bearish and continues to be quiet,"" analysts wrote.

""Perhaps utilisation of the Bitcoin network is lagging prices in this case. Ideally, renewed volatility and constructive price action sparks back demand for block-space. If not, it may suggest a more cautious framework is necessary in the weeks ahead.""
The last time that Bitcoin interacted with the $40,000 mark was during a brief revisit from lower levels in mid June."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3260251|public|self|we’re up🚀🚀😎|0|[]|0.44|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/os703y/were_up/|all_ads|6|1627310584.0|||||||||||||||||2021-07-26 20:13:04+00:00|t3_os703y|0|0||

Seeing that you guys are struggling, I have compiled a to-do list and a step-by-step guide to earn more clients on Reddit.

**Prerequisites:**

\- A Reddit account created less than 2 months ago. This is crucial, as fresh accounts add professionality.

\- Make sure you have no activity (comments or posts) anywhere else. This shows that you don't have time to spend on anything else but on giving advise. If you really have to be active, your posts and comments should a) be \[deleted\], b) be copy pasted advise on several subreddits, c) be confusing phrases including lots of ...'s. 

\- **BONUS** point if your account name includes any of: ""technical"", ""forex"", ""analysis"", ""trader"", ""advisor"". You should also include a short bio with multiple emojis. Furthermore, have a chad in suites as your profile picture (doesn't matter if it is you. This acts as your resume. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Example of a perfect profile picture + description](https://preview.redd.it/12si2z2onod71.png?width=403&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b826e4d1a43b78533073b4934769af01f1b2045)

**Where to find clients:**

\- Go for highly rated posts (go to hot or top) and contact the person with moons next to their name. Why? Because in r/cc moons = money = power = 26 cents. These people are rich money bags without any clue of how the economy works and your fancy graphs and tables can save them. DCA? HODL? Nah, what they need is rainbox unicorn phoenix inversed reverse graph. Help them out!

\- DM your clients when you locate them. Posting comments on r/cc advising yourself is against community rules. Don't know how to approach them? Too shy? Follow these formats:

&amp;#x200B;

[A\) the quick-to-business format](https://preview.redd.it/oxl0wlliood71.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71850d556d800c0aaac4a189381ca3ac59e92a7d)

A) The quick-to-point method

**After you get your contact on Reddit:**

\- Send a block of text explaining what you do, using fancy language and introducing yourself as an expert in the field. Also, let your clients know that you **absolutely need** a new platform for this to work (Whatsapp, Telegram, etc ...)

&amp;#x200B;

[One example of wall of text \(3 minutes after contacting client\)](https://preview.redd.it/6byy12qfpod71.png?width=369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ea83ccca18dae773718818b2ade2bc66f4c48f3)

\- After this, you've won the trust of your client! Ask him for his reddit password if you want access to his/her/their Moons, which are now worth a whopping American quarter! Good luck on your journey.

Since a couple of months I used to put a little bit of cash (50-100€) per month into some Crypto. Mainly ETH and DOGE. I didn't follow the news and also didn't check binance that often. But now I wanted to transfer my monthly money to Binance. Guess what I am from Europe and can't. 

I don't expect binance to fix this in the near future and wanted to ask you people, what you would recomend doing to someone having \~300€ worth in crypto all stored on his binance wallet, not having a credit card (it's now so common in Germany at least), and wanting to continue making small monthly purchases.

Tether is not able to back all the coin in circulation with assets even though it claims to be a stablecoin provider.  As of March this year, only a few percentage points of its coins were backed by cash or equivalents (e.g. cash and treasury bills). The value of reserves like commercial papers can not be evaluated without more transparency and an audit.

It is also true for banks do not back all their deposits with cash equivalents. This approach is called fractional banking. However, banks are regulated and provide significant transparency into where they keep their money which is not the case with Tether.
