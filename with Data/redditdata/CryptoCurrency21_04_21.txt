It's my personal decision, based on a few factors.

I've frequented r/cryptomoonshots since I got into crypto (3 years). It was a sub that had a few shillers, but good projects came here and there. Only invested a little at a selected coin (don't invest more than you blah blah blah).  I've found some great projects there, while there were in their infancy. TRAC, LTO, OMI, just to name a few. For all, I probably invested a bit too late.

Approx 2 months ago, the sub started to deteriorate. HOGE was one of the first coins I saw that had a deflationary thing (burn of tokens) going on. It skyrocketed in 2 weeks (approx 100x, over 1000x if you got in mid to late Feb). Before you know it, safemoon and safestar started their hype. ""The lightning does not  strike twice"", I thought. And missed the early early days of both. Another reason for not buying was that I didn't have enough confidence to invest on pancakeswap. It's hard to escape your own bias.

There were a lot of clones and gimmicks on HOGE (and Safemoon later on). The sub was filled to the brim with deflationary coins promising 100x or 1000x. 99% PnDs, scams and rugpulls. Names of tokens included words associated with crypto (everything from wallstreetbets, moon (WENMOON is my favorite crack at it), HODL, ELON, rocket, you name it).

Uniswap had/has much higher fees than Pancakeswap, so naturally, PnDs transferred to the BSC (it's easier to attract people that want to YOLO $20-50). Then, end of March, I saw I had some BNB dust from back in the day, and decided to put a bit of that into three BSC coins on pancakeswap. Two went belly up in a few hours (BSC tokens are easier to rug pull, as the fees are not as high as for the tokens on the ERC20 network). Safemoon was the only that got up.

After seeing all the ""SAFEMOON is a scam"" posts here in this sub (and against my better judgement as betting against this sub seems to be the winning strategy), I decided do my own research and came to a conclusion I don't want to participate in this. So I cashed out, maybe 5% below the ATH.

All in all, I had a nice 10x on my initial dust investment after all is said and done (Delta shows I had like 30% more money than I cashed out, even with the 10% tax on taking out the funds, another ""proof"" this is a scam). I managed to cover the cost of the two tokens. It's beer money, but still, will be injected into good projects.

TL, DR: it's most likely a scam, but I managed to get a small profit. Even if it does 100x, I don't want to make money that way.

Galaxy Digital, the cryptocurrency-focused financial services firm run by Michael Novogratz, is in advanced discussions to buy BitGo, the U.S.-regulated crypto custody specialist, according to four people familiar with the situation.

Both Galaxy and BitGo declined to comment.

Silicon Valley’s BitGo was last year reported to have been in acquisition talks with fintech giant PayPal. No deal was reached, but PayPal offered as much as $750 million in cash for the custody company, CoinDesk reported last month, citing two sources familiar with the matter. PayPal later agreed to acquire Curv, another cryptocurrency custody firm.

The logical solution for long-term scalability in this aspect would be to implement carbon credits into the cost of performing transactions to offset the energy usage needed to process these transactions.

I came across a new project creating a protocol to offset all carbon emissions generated by cryptocurrency transactions. Dovu ([https://www.dovu.earth/](https://www.dovu.earth/)) allows any other project to use its system to make their network carbon neutral. Ocean Protocol announced this morning they would be partnering with them for this purpose. The project uses Hedera Hashgraph to issue tokenized carbon credits to any carbon emitter to fund carbon-negative activities, such as soil sequestration by farmers. There is a nice write-up on the Hedera website: [https://hedera.com/users/dovu](https://hedera.com/users/dovu).

If this is the route we will take to become carbon neutral, adding a carbon tax to transaction fees would help the most energy efficient networks and could make the least efficient networks too expensive to use. Of course, energy inefficient networks likely would resist doing anything at all to reduce their carbon footprint. But once we have blockchains that can provably claim to be carbon neutral using something like Dovu, I think the people of the world will make the right choice and transact where they know the environmental impact will be neutralized.

TLDR: The most energy efficient crypto projects will win the race in the long term, as users will gravitate towards provably carbon neutral networks."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|2237639|public|self|It's Earth Day.

I know it’s more difficult with bitcoin to track people’s wallets especially if they are cold storing them, but with algo, everything is right there for every one to see.

A  billionaire has power because they command massive capital. But it's  not just the existence of that massive capital that makes them powerful,  its that its usage can be coordinated. Theoretically a mass of people  with just as much capital would be just as powerful as a billionaire if  they could coordinate their cash as well. But masses of people tend to  not be able to. So billionaires hold more power.

But  truth is, the majority of cash is held by the masses of people.  Billionaires and Corporations hold a small percentage of available cash,  as all their wealth tends to be in stock or other assets. But  ultimately cash is king, and directs the whole thing. People hold the  majority of cash. Just the people can't wield it because they aren't  coordinated.

But what if the  people were coordinated? This is the beauty of Gamestop and Dogecoin. It  is people waking up to the fact that through coordinated use of cash  they can make giants rise and fall over night. Never before in history  has there been something that enabled people to coordinate in mass to do  this like the internet has. Never before have there been overt examples  of this actually working. Gamestop and Dogecoin are just the beginning  of people waking up to this.

What  happens when more assets are in crypto, and Robinhood or whatever can't  shut down the market and limit it if it does something they don't want?  This gives the masses of people with cash even greater power to affect  as they wish.

I think this is the  true importance of Dogecoin, getting it to $1. It is a test. Like a  child learning to crawl, and walk. The mass of people are learning about  their power. That they can in a week make a new Ford, or even a new  Tesla, simply by choosing to do so. That they can even flip economic  hierarchies if they so choose to do so. Dogecoin is not about cashing  out, it's about people learning this is possible.

If  everyone cashed out all of their BTC and bought as much Doge as  possible, it would crash BTC, and force a move to Doge. This would most  likely happen with the smallest guy first, and moving up to the largest  guy. So all the small-time, inexperienced, doge idiots would now become  the first big investors of Doge, followed by the mid-sized guys, and  ultimately followed by the massive corporate hedge funds.

The  exit strategy of Doge is not everyone dumping at $1. It is literally  inverting the existing economic hierarchy that exists in Bitcoin.  Pulling the entire Bitcoin pyramid into Dogecoin upside down.

This  is why Dogecoin reaching Bitcoin marketcap is plausible. Which is about  a $9 doge. Imagine it. Could be done. Everyone just needs to sell all  BTC and move it to Doge and not sell. Its not about making money. Its  about helping the masses of society wake up to this power they have. If  it can go as far as it needs to, then the first runners to do this will  make massive amounts. But those at the end will not ""lose"", just their  cash will be in Doge, at similar value to whatever it was in before.

I am really starting to think this may be why Doge is so irrationally demonized. Its a threat.

* A full step-by-step Nault guide [here](https://docs.nault.cc/2021/04/20/multisig.html)
* And a [live video demo](https://youtu.be/cSfeQKP4PJE)

https://preview.redd.it/pr8dt90h6iu61.png?width=1565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a9dd5ba08f6e2e177f0cdfda7d332193b99bfa5

**What is multisig?**

Multi-signature is a way for multiple participants to own one private key each and combining them in a way so that only one common account is used to store the funds. Each participant only needs to know their particular key. Then by exchanging safe cryptographic data between the participants, a block signature is produced that can publish the corresponding block to the network.

More info in the original [multisig post for Keytools](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/mdjno1/release_nano_multisig_is_finally_here_enabling/)

**New multisig features in Nault:**

* Multisig generator
* Multi-tab mode: To make the data sharing process automatic if using local browser tabs for all private keys used on the same machine
* Integrated with current remote signing workflow allowing the block to be published
* Fully compatible with Keytools multisig: Can use one Nault and one Keytools since the data format is the same
* Semi compatible with the [original musig](https://plasmapower.github.io/musig-nano/): Can't use it it parallell but the multisig account is created the same way and funds can be recovered if Nault and Keytools would stop existing
* Full offline support meaning no private keys ever need to be exposed

**Additional feature:**

* [Keypair generator](https://nault.cc/keygenerator) for secure seed/ mnemonic/ private key (paper wallet)

**Important Note:**

The current multisig implementation is still M of M meaning if you lose any private keys the multisig account will be worthless. In the future, there will be M of N which means if you have 5 keys you can lose 2 of them. Simply not yet possible. But there is an example in Nault for how to share keys between 3 participants to **simulate M of N**:

* User 1 generates key A and B. Shares key A with user 2 and key B with user 3.
* User 2 generates key C and shares it with user 3.
* User 1 will own A and B. User 2 will own A and C. User 3 will own B and C.

By doing this you ensure no single user can take the funds but also ensure that one user can lose both their keys and still allow full recovery among the remaining two. Just a bit more complicated.

But the fees are astronomical. I know you can technically set your own, but my wallet only allows 3 settings (slow, medium, fast). Even the slowest is gonna charge me like a 15 dollar fee (although it fluctuates and I’ve seen it as low as 5). 

But if I try to exchange it for another currency it’s only gonna give me like 11 dollars in the other currency.

Yes, you can buy fractions of it. Yes, we all know this. 

If I wasn't invested in crypto, and I had 4k to invest, what would be more appealing?

0.072 BTC or 2 ETH?

The answer is pretty clear to me. 2 ETH just feels better. You're getting 2 wholes of something. Spending so much on a fraction of something just *feels* bad.

Humanity has never seen an asset priced like this. So the psychology at play, and effect it has, is undocumented and unresearched. Though, it seems logical to me that a crypto with an outlandish price makes people look elsewhere.

When stocks get too high, they do stock splits. Yes, this was originally because you couldn't buy fractional stocks. However, I now feel that it's done more as a psychological thing. Stock splits tend to result in the price pumping. Would TSLA have continued pumping so hard if they didn't stock split? I doubt it. I'm sure it would've still pumped, but not as much. Getting 5 TSLA for $2000 feels a lot better than getting 1 TSLA for $2000."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|2230485|public|self|Do you think the psychology around Bitcoins high price is holding it back?|0|[]|0.76|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mv5uxk/do_you_think_the_psychology_around_bitcoins_high/|all_ads|6|1618950493.0|||||||||||||||||2021-04-21 01:58:13+00:00|t3_mv5uxk|0|7||

A VPN-esque project who seems to be trying to accomplish a similar goal as Orchid (OXT) coin.  

The person who pointed it out to me showed me the current active user base of the end product (over 2.5mil people), showed me the app in the iTunes App Store, and showed me how they stake.  

1.) A active user base of 2.5mil people is absurd. I know they are completely different projects, have completely different uses, have completely different investment profiles, etc. and the comparison is a bad one. But, Bitcoin has an estimated 400,000 people actually use BTC for transactions daily.  IPX has 2.5mil+ people use their VPN daily.  A direct comparison is pretty meaningless.  But when BTC is a rounded 65,000X larger coin by market cap, yet has 1/6th the active users, I still feel like that drastic of an imbalance can provide useful insight if approached the right way. 

2.) Their app in the iTunes Store is insanely easy to use.  You literally just download it (called Tachyon VPN), and press the “on” button and then the VPN runs in the background.  Has worked getting around media that is not available in my country, and my work server (not allowed to use a personal VPN and access it) denies me access if I try to enter utilizing it.  So by all accounts I have (I am not very technical) the system works as a VPN and does all the things I use a VPN for. Also it is free.  So you can download it if you like. 

3.) the personal staking I was showed was insanely easy to do.  And much better/easier than any other staking I have done.  The most annoying this was downloading and setting up Bithumb to buy IPX, because I use CoinBase normally.   After I bought, you pretty much just send the coin to your wallet.  Go to IPXUS, confirm your wallet address, and it immediately starts functioning and you earn 10% ROI.  Setting up a stake through a personal wallet was overall easier than setting up a stake on CoinList for me.  


*SO*.  Here is the key question!  What am I missing?  The coin is worth $15mil market cap...  it has been around for a decent amount of time.  It has users, etc. AND I do not believe I am some genius that just found the holy grail.  Instead, I believe I am an idiot who is missing something big.

I’m going to psychoanalyze this. 

People are a bit greedy. This is inherent in probably mostly everyone. It’s ok. I am going to surmise that people assume subconsciously there are a limited amount of moons to be given and so they are more likely to comment (receive) than upvote (give).

I remember a post here talking about how moons are kind of ruining the quality of content on the sub. I lean toward the agree side of this argument, as nowadays all I see is regurgitated stuff or echo chamber emotional posts that garner thousands of dollars worth of moons. 

To say that most posts are not posted with monetary influence in mind now is a lie.. and this will have a ripple effect if more subreddits decide to implement this."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|2229425|public|self|The fact that my quality shitpost got 600% more comments than upvotes goes to show how moons affect this subs content.|4|[]|0.74|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mv4jey/the_fact_that_my_quality_shitpost_got_600_more/|all_ads|6|1618945679.0|||||||||||||||||2021-04-21 00:37:59+00:00|t3_mv4jey|0|250||

He believes that, because of all the money printed during the pandemic, the world is gonna land in a crisis and people won't be able to invest in crypto, cause they will need the money for other stuff, therefore crypto will crash. I don't agree with his idea, because I think people will invest in crypto to not lose money, otherwise they will lose it to inflation.

I was too late for BTC or ETH. I have some other coins but I’d appreciate if you could recommend some coins that are just growing now or have the potential but have still a low price and haven’t gone massive already. (I have saved and my maximum to invest is like $50-$100). 

Basically I would want to be early for once so I can at least make $1000 in investments (that would be awesome here🙌🏼).

February 7, 2021.  I wanted to make a bet.  Online.  Was going to bet on Pepe making a td, 1mil to 1 odds just for fun.  Couldn't do it.  I live in Nevada, they block internet sports gambling.  Wow.  That's  f'd up.   After being bummed for a while, and watching  the SB (which was great) I remembered some 'things' from my previous research.  Bitcoin.  Mining.  $$$.

What's all that about?   Fast forward 2 weeks, i'm in 4k ROI for GPU's (1060's mostly on ebay).  I set up a rig that makes $600/month.  Had  plans to endlessly add to it, but read about eth2 and proof of stake vs work.  Decided to hold there.

Still, i was starting to love crypto.  Got a Coinbase account, bought some BTC.  Heard about Doge, so setup a Kraken account.  Buy, transfer, wait.  I blew it there, I guess, my 9800 Doge at .058 I sold and transferred back to my new trading account BinanceUS for Cardano, my latest passion. 

At this point I had a couple grand invested in Coinbase, and 4 in BinanceUS.  I used CB as my investments and BinanceUS for daytrading crypto.  24/7 market, no min buyin, it was heaven.  I made $150 once or twice, lost a bit, got even, pulled ahead.  Nice.  I bought Doge again.  It went up.  I didn't sell even after the peak.  Made 1.5k instead of 3k.  Cool.  Fun, i'm winning a bit.  I'm also kinda making a lot of mistakes, but still ok.  

At this point I reflected a bit on my methods.  I'm a bit jumpy on the daytrades, so can lose by panicking.  I can be late on a spike, buying in when it's about to tumble.  I sleep sometimes and miss opportunities.  My  main fault was buying into a downtrend.  Just wait.  I learned, made out ok.

Then I went up a level.  Buy cryptos that are up and coming.  Super cheap, super risky.  I loved it.  A torturous adventure ensued, setting up trustwallet, transferring bnb from binanceUS, converting it to the BSC, then using PancakeSwap to actually buy Safemoon.  $500 in,  it doubled in minutes.  Then dropped back a couple hours later.  Then doubled again.  Ok.  Volatile, but solid.  I dropped 2k more in.  Now with 266mil Safemoon coins, i'm feeling good.  I share it on FB, and TV forums.  I go the next level even, MoonRat.  Another hellish adventure with BNB not withdrawing from BinanceUS because everyone trying to buy Safemoon.  Wait it out, buy in for 11Billion MoonRat.  My million account, and my Billion.  

Now I wait.  I keep daytrading Doge and Cardano.  Keep working my job.  Keep looking for brand new cryptos.  No worries, no fear, just figure it out, do it.  A couple hours of work can pay off big.  It makes you learn, grow, and possibly will change your life financially.  Don't quit if you're bad at it, it takes time.  Use the experiences as lessons.  And, most importantly, if you do make a mil/bil, stay human.  Help others.  Family, friends, randoms.  Good luck my friends.  yj."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|2236737|public|self|Diary of a Crypto Madman|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mvcszf/diary_of_a_crypto_madman/|all_ads|6|1618981391.0|||||||||||||||||2021-04-21 10:33:11+00:00|t3_mvcszf|0|1||
