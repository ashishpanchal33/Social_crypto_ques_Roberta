I've most recently looked into a bunch of Play to Earn Games for cryptocurrency. Below is my experience over the last month or so. Please remember this is just my opinion, and is no means financial advice. I also want to mention that I tried to not spend money as much as I could on any of these games. Appreciate some discussion on these topics as well! 

**Note:** Platform is the platform I played on, but it may be available on other platforms. The 'Time Consuming' metric measures how much time is required to put into the game (higher the number means more of your free time)

**COIN: Explore the World**

Platform: iOS

FreeToEarn: Yes

Token/Currency: XYO ($0.041)

Location based app that awards you for 'geomining' your current location every few seconds or so. You can either use it when walking/driving or gain by using it at home. Honestly the gains are extremely minimal. You can somewhere around 0.02 -&gt; 0.1 COIN per geomine every few minutes ( this can vary). Once you get 10,000 COIN you can trade it in for XYO. I'm not sure what the conversion rate is, but it definitely isn't 1:1 ( I think you get about around 460 XYO for every 10,000 COIN ). The best way to make COIN in this game is by doing the surveys, but these can be extremely frustrating and long. Sometimes you can spend 10-15+ mins on one just for it to not reward you any COIN. Usually surveys reward you with 800-1,000 coin each. So if you love answering monotous questions, then go for it. There are also PRO and MASTER tiers you can spend $25/$35 a month on for etra rewards. Not sure if that is worth it or not. 

Fun: 2/10

Time Consuming: 3/10

Rewards: 5/10

Verdict: Don't really recommend

**Eggrypto**

Platform: iOS

FreeToEarn: Yes

Token/Currency: N/A

This is a very casual monster collection game, where you have a very (VERY!) small chance of earning NFTs of rare monsters. There is a gacha element as well, but you can't get NFT monsters (called raremon) this way as far as I can tell - only 1-5 star monsters. The better your team is, the higher mission level you can play which has slightly increased chances of catching a different raremon through a rare egg. There is a stamina system so you can't really run too many missions in a row. It is a pretty grindy and repetitive game but it's actually pretty fun to play for a minute or two then put back down. The chances of raremon drops are usually around 0.004% - which is incredibly low - but it's still fun building up your team BP and fusing monsters to get stronger. 

Fun: 6/10

Time Consuming: 4/10

Rewards: NFT of raremon (Very low drop rate)

Verdict: I actually really enjoy this game, but don't go into it expecting to make any money.

**Handypick**

Platform: iOS

FreeToEarn: Yes

Token/Currency: HANDY ($0.03)

This is an app where you can guess certain price movements of cryptocurrencies. It's very basic, but not time consuming. You also get a daily login reward. The rewards for daily login and correct guesses come in the form of 'Points'. This can be traded in for HANDY at a rate of 1,000 Point = 23.7 HANDY at the time of writing this. You can only exchange this once you hit 50,000 Points. I wouldn't expect anything more than 15,000+ Points per month unless you somehow win a bunch of these guesses. I haven't won a single one yet in a few weeks and I'm not sure why to be honest. There is an option for surveys but I haven't received any either. 

Fun: 4/10

Time Consuming: 2/10

Rewards: Points -&gt; HANDY

Verdict: I mean.. I recommend it just for a daily login and some guesses of price movements. Nothing too amazing though

**NeonDistrict**

Platform: Web

FreeToEarn: Yes

Token/Currency: N/A

This is a weird one for me. You can log into the neondistrict site and connect your wallet and start constructing your team for free. It's an auto battler 'rpg' game. You can earn NFTs through loot boxes at a low drop rate. In order to purchase these loot boxes you need to acquire NEON. 300 NEON = 0.001 ETH. Each Loot box costs 500 NEON. Another way to earn is by sending your squad on 'Pizza Deliveries' to earn NEON - probably 60-70 neon every 8 hours ( or more if your team is better and want to risk getting 'ambushed'). To me, this seems like a game from the early days of the internet - there's not much here at all. It's barely even a game. You just set your team and check back whenever. I still am currently using it since it's very little effort. Also I'm not a fan of the character models very much - they look a bit unsettling. You can also buy NFTs to equip your characters to be stronger - but why? just to make pizza deliveries?? what even is this game.

Fun: 0/10

Time Consuming: 1/10

Rewards: NFT drops from loot crates

Verdict: Unless they start adding PVP/actual battles, I don't really recommend it. 

**Ethermon**

Platform: Web

FreeToEarn: Yes..

Token/Currency: EMON ($0.1984)

Let me just start by saing the UI of this game is pretty bad and at times unresponsive. It's awful. This is barely a game. You select your team and you auto battle against other ethermon in tournaments. You have 10 (or 20 if you own an on-chain ethermon) energy that gets recharged at 8 AM/PM UTC. You are gifted 3 off-chain ethermon to start (You can't sell these). Each battle costs 2 energy. There are some daily quests but honestly without putting money into this, you can only play about 5 minutes a day in its current state. For me, I have been playing it twice a day just to see where I can get to but 

I have only received one more free (off-chain) ethermon. If your team is good enough you can enter a tournament where you can gain EMON per win. I'm not sure how much. You can also gain EMON if you are in the top % of each tournament but in order to get that good you prob need to buy on-chain ethermon.

Fun: 2/10

Time Consuming: 1/10

Rewards: EMON 

Verdict: Not worth F2P right now, imo. But itss not time consuming at all.

**Dragonary**

Platform: PC

Token/Currency: CYT ($0.15)

This game hardly has any features at all and is barely a game in its current state (Like these other games I've tried). You can breed dragons and fight them. Each dragon has a different rarity - common,uncommon,rare,legendary,mystic something like that. At the end of each day, you get rewards based on your total account rarity and if you've played a certain amount. As an example, my account is a common rarity and I've been getting around 0.125 CYT per day.. which is.... something? I guess. In order to get higher rarity dragons you need to either breed them (Costs CYT) or buy them from the marketplace (NFT). Also buying CYT is fun - just need to purchase BNB on binance, then send to metamask, then convert to CYT, then send to coinary, then transfer to dragonary game. It is another auto-battler against cpu 'missions' you can select from to level up your dragons. No PVP yet from what I can see. There is an energy part of the game where you can only collect items as long as you have enough energy - and this is recharged VERY slowly - or by purchasing CYT. 

Fun: 2/10

Time Consuming: 2/10

Rewards: CYT and NFT if you breed your dragons enough (Rare+)

Verdict: I don't know.. I really don't know.. If they make improvements maybe it's ok, but I'd be embarassed to tell anyone I've ever played this game.

**Town Star**

Platform: Web

Token/Currency: GALA ($0.0482)

This game is probably the most fun game I've tried yet. You enter in weekly tournaments and the top 100 or 1,000? users gain GALA. It's similar to farmville kind of. You need to manage your crops/resources/workers and sell to make a profit. You can select your starting farm from around the world. I have 3 main problems. 

1. It is pretty time consuming - granted you can leave it running when you get to a certain point, but you need to be somewhat active to gain points in the tournament (or write scripts/macros to do it.) 

2. You really need to learn the meta in order to do well. You will need to sink quite a bit into learning how to best gain points/money during the tournament

3. Users can purchase NFTs to gain an advantage over farms that are F2P. 

All that being said, it's actually a pretty fun farm management game, and pretty in-depth.

Fun: 6.9/10 (nice)

Time Consuming: 6.5/10

Rewards: GALA for placing high in tournaments

Verdict: I actually might recommend this if you enjoy these kind of games and have a bunch of free time on your hands.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I think most of these games prioritize NFT/Tokens over having fun. You can't really earn unless you put something into it for the most part. So for free to play to earn - I've been enjoying eggrypto the most so far.

I am looking forward to the future of blockchain games and play to earn - hopefully there are some much better titles coming out in the future.

I will be making a post soon about other passive incomes I've come across such as Brave,Presearch,Verasity, and Odysee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok. That's it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, as the tittle says, I don't think crypto will perish anytime soon. I know almost everybody here agrees with me, but I want to share my take on this, and why I think we're living one of those major revolutions on our species history.

&amp;#x200B;

With this said, I actually don't have a clue if any of the cryptos we're seeing today will be around in 100 years from know, although I think that BTC as a store of value and ETH as the main blockchain - if they manage to solve the gas problems anytime soon - are the major candidates for a long run.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless of that, my point is why I'm so confindent about **Crypto Revolution**, and i'll share my reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

\- **We're seeing a world's onlinization trend** that won't disappear. In fact, I think we'll see even a major speed in the way that change is happening. From *buy everything and get delivered at home*, to more and more people working remotely, VR getting crazy, well, you name it. The truth is that our online avatars seem to be more present than ever, and I'm not seeing that change in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **People are more suspicious of institutions centralized power** and one great example is the huge nr of people who don't want to take Covid's vaccines because they lack trust in authorities. There's no doubt insitutions need a big update and to profoundly change the way they operate, and become more clearer. Blockchain revolution seems to be the tool that could change all the shady stuff that happens without public awareness. Smartcontracts could remake the way we conceive trust without the need of a third party.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Millenials are FUKD.** This pretty much say it all. We don't recognize anymore the values of this society where we grew, and although we might fear the change it's happening, we know we have nothing to lose. And someone with nothing to lose is always a catalyst for change. The generations after ours will be even more eager for a deep transformation in the way things work.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Greed, lack of proper regulation and enforcement** made world's economy a big bucket of shit. Huge unpayable debts, fake grow with no new jobs, and the way wealth is being distributed can't last much longer without an implosion. We have big banks, hedge funds and big investment partnerships sucking all the wealth and stopping evolution (like shorting into oblivion companies that could bring the cure for cancer, for instance), while enjoying the money glitch to fuck everybody else.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **We have to get trust back** because trust and barter has been what made homo sapiens what he is today. Without that, we either fall in war or in hands of dictatorships.

I'm not saying everything will be perfect, or that crypto will end injust wealth distribution and solve all the problems. It wont. A lot of wealth is already settling in crypto and markets will be manipulated too. But not in the same degree we're seeing today. If we manage to shift to a blockchain based economy, things will be clearer, politicians will have to show every accounting, and same goes for big companies. Will have our data protected and secured, and **WE'LL** be the ones deciding when and where we'll share it. If the status quo want to fight crypto, they must shut down all internet. Otherwise, this change is inevitable. And for the average millenial Joe, it's the best thing that can happen. Does this make sense to you guys??"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3469754|public|self|Why Crypto has come to stay!|2|[]|0.77|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ppdorm/why_crypto_has_come_to_stay/|all_ads|6|1631780441.0||||||||||||||2021-09-16 13:50:41+00:00|t3_ppdorm|0|18||

The portfolio being:

70% - split evenly between Eth, BTC, Algo and Dot

20% - Cardano and xrp combined evenly 

5% - chainlink

5%- rly, amp, doge, Safemoon, all split evenly 

Bob is super high on eth and btc(obviously) but extremely high on Algo and dot, since there is more potential to get more coins/tokens. He believes in their leadership and sees real use out of them. Thinking they can both coexist with eth and btc. He also likes cardano and xrp. Believing both to be just slightly behind dot. But not near Algo. So there is some wiggle room there. The rest is up for suggestions as well.

In around two months Bitcoin is going to have a soft-fork called Taproot. You can view the countdown here: 

[https://www.nicehash.com/countdown/btc-forking-2021-11-15-12-00](https://www.nicehash.com/countdown/btc-forking-2021-11-15-12-00)

Taproot is the biggest upgrade to the Bitcoin Protocol in the last four years. The previous being the very contentious SegWit. Taproot is a soft-fork meaning nodes which don't upgrade can still work on the protocol. Also, this one is not as controversial as SegWit and most nodes are on board. 

**What does Taproot do?** 

Generally it allows for greater privacy, lower fees, greater smart contract functionality, and Lightning Network being more easily integrated. 

Right now Bitcoin uses the *Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm* but with Taproot Bitcoin will switch to *Schnorr signatures* making simple (normal transactions, etc.) and complex transactions (so smart contracts, etc.) indistinguishable from each other. By this signature change, Lightning Network will also be more easily integrated with the base protocol and smart contracts will also have an easier time integrating with the protocol. 

Switching to *Schnorr signatures* also stores less data on the blockchain which will increase the transactions per seconds, and lower fees.

If the rewards are more coins being added isn't this inflation and you aren't really earning anything?

*Addiction:  A biopsychosocial disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite adverse consequences*

Most of us started with minimal amounts when we started until we reached today snd we look at our portfolios and check the graphs, see a tweet, check reddit, go back to the charts, call our crypto-buddy discuss news, farm .. etc 

This all is huge and time consuming ! 

1) How do you define an alcoholic from a a person who enjoys drinking alcohol normally? 

 2) What’s the difference between a man who smokes weed for fun or someone who fails their exams because of being stoned the whole time? 

3) How do we diagnose a patient with depression vs. normal mood fluctuation in an individual? 

4) How do you differentiate between a person with an eating disorder or a person who cares about what they eat and how they look? 


The answer to all questions (1-4) is one :

*If the subject’s ordinary daily routines, social relations and career are disrupted then this is called a Disorder*

I love this sub and made out many friends some of them are 30 years older ! But at the end, real life lies beyond your screen.


Look away from your phone every now and then, Bears and Bulls will come your way either you look or not. 
Buy your coins. 
Close your apps. 

Go out breathe some fresh air, sit by the river, See your parents while they’re still alive, no amount of money in the world will compensate their existence in your life…
See your friends, have a drink. 

Make sure your career isn’t damaged but your interest in Crypto, make sure you care about the people who care about you.

&amp;#x200B;

I made a deposit few days ago of $20,000 in crypto I made some exchanges into BTC and TRX 

And like many of you when I tried to withdraw it kept in ""processing"" its been several days and every time I contact their CS team they just keep saying wait wait wait

&amp;#x200B;

I saw many treads everywhere already about people complaining about similar cases and yet they keep promoting their own token and even encouraging other users to exchange some other tokens in their platform as promos - (This by LAW is already fraud if they still allowing people to keep depositing to their platform and now allowing them to withdraw)

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all this, I am also going ahead and reaching Google and Apple reps with whom I've been working with many years through my own digital marketing agencies for big clients.

&amp;#x200B;

it's time to take action and make sure this platform doesn't operate any longer if they are not fulfilling their obligations and taking care of their users I am surprised that their apps are still available with so many reports until now.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyone who got affected by them send me an email with details, proofs and together we'll take actions against everyone whos behind this SCAM 

&amp;#x200B;

I will update and not change this post until they resolve mine and until we have proofs they are doing the right thing and not just SCAMMING innocent people."|False|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3467467|public|self|Public and Legal actions against Bithumb company|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pp0r6r/public_and_legal_actions_against_bithumb_company/|all_ads|6|1631725821.0||||||||||||||2021-09-15 22:40:21+00:00|t3_pp0r6r|0|2||

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if you could give me information about how to identify a potential rug pull.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me give you the following example: I have seen a twitter post advertising the cakemoon token.

When looking at the holders: [https://bscscan.com/token/0x1659b9f69406f6224d84c9e22a482ad2f2f50f3a#balances](https://bscscan.com/token/0x1659b9f69406f6224d84c9e22a482ad2f2f50f3a#balances)

I have noticed that only 2% of the token are in the pancakeswap wallet and the majority is held in other wallets. One wallet even holds 40%.

Also it is not like most of the liquidity has been sold from PCS. Here I can see that PCS at most has received 13% of the total liquidity: [https://bscscan.com/token/0x1659b9f69406f6224d84c9e22a482ad2f2f50f3a?a=0x6df94d82ec413134be0c9d5ac40c3f6d4b9a88e6](https://bscscan.com/token/0x1659b9f69406f6224d84c9e22a482ad2f2f50f3a?a=0x6df94d82ec413134be0c9d5ac40c3f6d4b9a88e6)"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3467007|public|self|Is this a potential rugpull|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/poxuv2/is_this_a_potential_rugpull/|all_ads|6|1631716666.0|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'OyQ2U3Z5ETil50U6i6-F3QrfEg0GLBwrzHOtcymHxMY', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zqJ2ke1jIw-RIgn186r7bvgwKH7sjPPdPUJuh1R5sGo.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c3efe367cdd6fc7f48d289abbe152e843c169d', 'width': 108}], 'source': {'height': 122, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zqJ2ke1jIw-RIgn186r7bvgwKH7sjPPdPUJuh1R5sGo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f23ae916fb15c24bb2852bdd084462ddf7d4ff83', 'width': 122}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||||||2021-09-15 20:07:46+00:00|t3_poxuv2|0|2||

2) Will other bank will follow this step ( when banks started blocking crypto Exchanges transaction in your country Did banks followed like domino?

In the last decade, its community of social media followers has grown from zero to more than 140 million fans and is now one of the largest in football. It has also opened offices in Doha, Shanghai and Singapore.\n\nA forward-thinking club, in 2016 it added an eSports team to its men’s football, women’s football, handball and judo teams.\n\nCommitted to giving something back to the community, the club has significantly increased funding for its Foundation with the aim of developing effective and far-reaching programmes. And through its Red and Blue Schools initiative – just one of the many programmes it runs – Paris Saint-Germain lends a helping hand to disadvantaged young people.\n\nAbout Crypto.com\n\nFounded in 2016, Crypto.com today serves over 10 million customers with the world’s fastest growing crypto app, along with the Crypto.com Visa Card — the world’s largest crypto card program — the Crypto.com Exchange and Crypto.com DeFi Wallet.

I will show to original image and give the actual data for comparison.

Nowadays the data would look like this:

US tax revenue: 3.420.000.000.000

FED budget 2020: 6.550.000.000.000

New debt: 3.130.000.000.000

National Debt: 26.700.000.000.000

Let's take 8 zeros and pretend it's a family:

Income: 34.200

Expenditure: 65.500

New debt: 31.300

Total debt: 267.000

Who in his right mind would lend money to someone with this balance? They owe 8 times their income already and last year they spent double of what their income was. I wouldn't and I know you wouldn't too.

Well, saving in dollars is like lending to this family, because they own the money printer and they will use it to dilute their debts. Use crypto to shelter from inflation and fiscal irresponsibility. You are slowly but surely getting rug pulled by the US goverment.

If it's a solid long term investment (mine are BTC, ETH, ADA, DOT, ALGO, ATOM, LINK), there is no intent of taking profits for years -- it'll be untouched, aside from buying more.
