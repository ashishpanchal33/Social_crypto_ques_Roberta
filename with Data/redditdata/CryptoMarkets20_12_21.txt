When a sell order is fully executed, the bot instantly places another purchase order at a lower grid level, and vice versa.\n\n## What is Grid\xa0Trading?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5e1db99bzn371.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5efa989233ac8032ffca23f3684a3de23e1877f3\n\nGrid trading is a trading method that comprises placing a series of buy and sell orders at predefined intervals around a fixed price. It develops a commerce grid in this manner.\xa0\n\nGrid trading works best in a competitive market with regular price variations. It assures profitability each time the selling price surpasses the purchase price during a lateral price movement by automatically executing low purchase orders that lead to high sell orders, hence eliminating the need for market forecasting.\n\nA variety of factors must be considered in order to enhance grid trading earnings. What if I told you that there is a method for you to profit from this volatility? What if you could automate your trades and just sit back and watch your earnings roll in on a regular basis?\xa0\n\nA pair with frequent and large ups and downs, but a rather constant average price over the long term, for example, is almost certainly a strong choice for Grid Trading. With that stated, let us go through the essentials.\n\n## 5 Benefits Of Using a Grid Trading\xa0Bot\n\n**1.Trustworthy Crypto Trading Strategy**\n\nGrid Trading has been around for a long time and is a well-established, well-tested, and profitable trading approach. There are several instances of successful traders employing it for decades on a variety of marketplaces. The crypto business, in particular, has shown to be one of the most trustworthy venues for Grid Trading methods due to its extreme volatility.\n\n**2. Usability**\n\nThe strategy is straightforward to understand and use because it does not contain any sophisticated calculations, measurements, or market indicators. It will be simple to set up for entities with no past expertise in the crypto trading markets.\n\n**3. Adaptability**\n\nThe Grid Trading applies the most fundamental trading concept (buy low, sell high, earn the difference), therefore it can be applied to nearly any market and effectively generate a profit, independent of trend or market behaviour.\n\nYou may actively determine the frequency and period of the strategy by selecting the price range and number of grids.\n\nGrids can be set up for the short term, getting hundreds of trades every hour to capture micro profit from all of the day’s minor changes, or for the long term, by selecting a large range and leaving it to run for months to gain profit from every larger trend shift.\n\n**4. Enhance Risk Management**\n\nThe freedom to pick your grid strategy allows you to control the risk/reward level more actively than in most other types of trading. You may use a GRID Bot to generate a consistent modest profit with almost little risk (for example, by picking a stablecoin pair like BUSD/USDT), or you may take higher chances for potentially massive rewards (e.g., with a low market cap coin that has high fluctuations)\n\n**5. Automated trading**\n\nGrid Trading is particularly open to automation because to its evident logic and the fact that all of its actions are predefined and unrelated to market behaviour. Not only that, but using Grid Trading with a Trading Bot is considerably easier and more efficient than trying to follow the strategy with manual trades.\n\nIt’s one of the greatest methods for traders looking to take their initial steps towards automation since it can operate on practically any market, in any condition, 24/7, and can be set for almost any timeframe.\n\n## Key things you should know before running a grid\xa0bot\n\nFees are a vital consideration since they constantly have an influence on your trading results. Exchanges with minimal costs, that offer periodic zero-cost events, or give fee refunds that you may obtain as a market-maker, have a significant influence on your grid trading.\n\nFind the best pairs and market circumstances you can and learn how to read the market, look through charts, and acquire a feeling of what you need to search for.\n\nLook for charts with a sideways or modest uptick, but make sure you don’t observe any indications of a long-term downturn.\n\nLook for a pair that has already seen frequent and significant price swings, but that also does not appear to be about to exit your price range anytime soon.\n\n## What Could Go Wrong With Grid Trading\xa0Bot?\n\n**Scenario 1\xa0:** If prices go above your range, the grid bot would’ve sold all the position &amp; you won’t be able to benefit from the rising price. In this case, it would’ve been better to just buy &amp; hold.\n\n**Scenario 2\xa0:** If prices go below your range, It’ll use all the funds to buy the coin &amp; will generate losses as the prices go below your range. In this case, even the best grid bot in the world wouldn’t make profits easily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Best Stratergy For Grid Trading\xa0Bot?\n\nAccording to [KuCoin’s article](https://medium.com/kucoinexchange/kucoin-trading-bot-is-coming-how-to-make-passive-income-with-it-ba5d62fbba48),\n\n&gt;\xa0Actually, the profits from Grid Trading consists of two parts: grid profits and floating returns. The grid profits will always be positive as it is the returns from Buy Low and Sell High. This part is also our main source of income when executing Grid Trading. Floating returns might be both positive and negative as it is decided by the price changes of the token chosen. If you believe that the token price will gradually go up in the long turn, the floating return will also be positive. This also teaches us that choosing a token whose price may recently go down for grid trading is not that smart.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As all grid traders are focusing more on the grid profits, here are some ways to increase this part of earnings:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A reasonable starting price: You’d better enter the market at a relatively low price as the decline of token price will result in floating losses.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A reasonable price range: If the price range is too vast, your funds won’t be effectively utilized, while when it’s too small, even small price fluctuations can drive the bot to leave the range.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A reasonable number of grid: When the grid is too tight, the profits in a single grid will be quite low, barely covering the trading fee in the worst case; but when set too wide, the funds cannot be fully utilized.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So all in all, a smart grid trader will set up a reasonable grid that maximizes fund utilization based on historical volatility, their own funds, and trading costs.\n\n[***Continue this post here.***](https://medium.com/coinmonks/what-is-a-grid-trading-bot-3b58f3ec059b)', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Grid Trading\xa0Bot?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grid Trading Bot is a trading bot that assists you in carrying out the Grid Trading Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\xa0It enables you to place a series of purchase and sell orders within a given price range.

Listen up gang, we got a real moonshot here so load your bags before liftoff. How do I know? I'm one of the Devs.

What a journey it has been, but the time has finally come and we have launched the pinksale. This is not just a moonshot, it's a moonshot with justification. So let's start right there, myself and the CEO are completely doxxed:

What's amazing about what we have done so far, is this team formed only about a month ago and have since delivered this quality of work in a very short period of time. But let's get talking about the token:

ManyWorld's is essentially broken up into 3 areas: Visionary tokenomics, Utility, and Entertainment

# Tokenomics

We have created the worlds first marginal tax system in the crypto space :) This means that the tokens you hold behave differently depending on when you purchased them in terms of taxes paid and rewards received. Our token pays you weekly BUSD rewards for holding depending on the length that you hold!

Current BUSD rewards based systems levy a heavy tax on both the buy and sell side, most in the range of 13-14%. They then distribute those rewards on an hourly basis (huge gas fees) evenly among all token holders depending on how many you are holding. The reason they are all the same is because EverGrow ($EGC) was the creator of BUSD rewards contracts and ever contract since has been a copy and paste of it.

Problem: This system only caters to the early whales by creating a 50% burn at launch and having a tax so heavy that as the price of the underlying asset increases, the taxes simply are not worth paying for later investors in terms of BUSD rewards. Volume is the only way to generate BUSD rewards and a 13% buy tax and 13% sell tax makes this impossible to trade since you would need 30% returns simply to break even. The only real reason to purchase a token like this is the BUSD rewards, but again the same problem arises that between the heavy taxes and the immediate 50% burn, the BUSD rewards generated for later investors won't even be enough to cover the taxes.

Solution: 50% burn on a quarterly schedule and the world's first marginal tax system.

**Buy Tax**

The buy tax is 3% as compared to 13-14%, immediately resolving the barrier to entry problem. But if our buy tax is so much lower than how can we possibly issue BUSD rewards at a better rate? That answer is in the marginal sell tax system.

**Sell Tax**

At the time of purchase, whatever tokens were purchased begin aging. Yes, this means if you purchased some tokens today and then purchased some tokens next week, each group of tokens that you own is now aging at a different rate and therefore earning different rewards:

Level Rewards:

&amp;#x200B;

|Level|Milestone Age|Feature Unlocked|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|1st Day|Lottery|
|2|8th Day|BUSD Rewards Kit|
|3|91st Day|BUSD Upgrade Kit|
|4|180th Day|Redacted|
|5|Redacted Day|Redacted|

Taxes:

&amp;#x200B;

|Level 1 Sales Tax|Level 2 Sales Tax|Level 3 Sales Tax|
|:-|:-|:-|
|3%|8%|12%|

As your tokens age, you earn more and more rewards and the sell tax increases up to the cap of the L3 sales tax.

# Rewards

**Level 1 Lottery**: At level 1, meaning starting from the moment you purchase, you are able to participate in the daily lottery. Every token purchased within a 24 hour period counts towards entries into the daily lottery. At the end of each 24 hour period, 10 wallets who have entered that day are randomly selected and the winnings are distributed evenly among those 10 winners. Not only is this just cool, it greatly helps with the volume problems of other BUSD rewards contracts.

Between the lottery, low buy tax, and low level 1 sell tax, this is the only stablecoin rewards based system in existence that makes it possible for day traders/swing traders to participate in.

**Level 2 BUSD Rewards Kit:** At Level 2, tokens start earning rewards from the L2 rewards wallet paid out on a weekly basis. Every Monday, rewards are distributed from this wallet to all Level 2 tokens in circulation.

**Level 3 BUSD Rewards Upgrade Kit:** At Level 3, tokens start earning rewards from the L3 wallet in addition to the L2 wallet. So all Level 3 tokens in circulation will receive their BUSD rewards from both the L2 and L3 wallet.

**Beyond Level 3:** Our taxes cap at Level 3 but we are still tracking the age of tokens beyond that. This gives us the ability to pay out even more rewards from other parts of the ecosystem which you can read about in the whitepaper.

# Utility

The idea behind Many World's is to not create some massive system and be in competition with the titans of the industry, but instead to create bridge utility between client/ecosystem, ecosystem/ecosystem, and metaverse/metaverse. The first stage of that process is going to happen within our own ecosystem and connections will happen with partners and internal projects as we continue to build out the software. You can read more about the utility [here](https://docs.manyworldstoken.com/whitepaper/usdmany-worlds-platform/vision).

# Entertainment

One of the Devs is an executive in an entertainment design and development company that creates innovative content for film, television, streaming platforms, home video, and themed entertainment attractions on a global scale and has developed animated TV series’ that are on Disney+ and animated media for IP-based themed attractions.

Through this strategic partnership, we will have the capacity to take on new ecosystems with an entertainment focus and we will expand our stories from NFT Comics that will be traded at our NFT Trading Post to Metaverse PTE Games, NFT Avatars, Mobile Games, Animated Feature Films, Animated TV Series, Tabletop Games, Trading Cards, and so on.

The art that was teased above is to show what our first NFT Comic Books will look like before we move into the other industries noted above.

# Summary

This is 1000x opportunity but not just from the need to hype it up. With our visionary tokenomics, well-connected and transparent dev team, utility use-cases, strategic partners, and awesome ecosystem, this is a crypto moon shot that won't just touch the moon and come plummeting back to Earth, but it can reach the moon, build a base, and then head further across the cosmos. If you're eager to get started please review the links posted at the top but if at this point your screaming ""take my money"", join the discord for an opportunity to be part of the whitelist.

**THE DEADLINE TO PLEDGE IS DEC 20TH AT 4PM, PLEASE JOIN THE DISCORD FOR THE PLEDGE FORM.**

**TL;DR:** Doxxed leaders, audited by Solidity, worlds first marginal crypto tax system, stablecoin rewards, daily lottery, amazing art, big ambitious plans, and we are just starting the pinksale this weekend. With the ability to have multiple tax lots that are also rewarded differently, we created a healthy trading environment for traders of all classes and sizes and a scalable environment that doesn't have a barrier to entry only rewarding the early whales.

This is a sure thing. Honestly I can't find a reason for people not to accept and enjoy the new lifestyle that blockchain platform are giving us. I mean we've lived years before the internet, and people never thought of needing it before it actually existed. It is going to be the same with blockchain and crypto.

Nobody knows the importance of this space until it happens to exist. I mean we are satisfied with the current online shopping standarts that we have right? What if I tell you there are blockchain platforms like Suku, working on upgrading these standards and allowing users to track and verify the authenticity of their online purchases?

This is the kind of change that will bring all the people together and will actually be beneficial for everyone. No matter how long it will take for people to accept it, but eventually everyone will be using blockchain platforms at the end of the day."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|682952|public|self|The change is hard to accept, I know that, and most people prefer to live in their comfort zone.

Bitcoin aims to provide an alternative to the current monetary and financial system. Eventually, more and more people will opt for the Bitcoin system instead of the current system.

After trying to destroy Bitcoin throughout the 2010s by constantly denigrating it to the general public with false arguments, private banks finally realized that their best solution was to join the Bitcoin revolution.

This is what American banks are doing now, like JPMorgan. They are offering Bitcoin to their customers.

However, you should beware that these banks are trying to steal the liberating power of the Bitcoin revolution by becoming intermediaries between you and the Bitcoin system. Because Bitcoin is all about freeing you from these middlemen. By buying Bitcoin through intermediaries, you are missing out on the huge advantage of Bitcoin. You are leaving the power on the fruits of your labor to a third party.

In the future, it is certain that central banks will end up buying Bitcoin as well. Because if Bitcoin doesn't need central banks, central banks will need Bitcoin sooner or later. Again, it will be better for you to own Bitcoin in this eventuality.

It's only a matter of time in my opinion, as I explain in detail in the latest issue of the In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter: [**https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/if-you-cant-kill-bitcoin-join-bitcoin**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/if-you-cant-kill-bitcoin-join-bitcoin)"|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|682805|public|self|If You Can’t Kill Bitcoin, Join Bitcoin – Central Banks Will Follow the Same Path As Private Banks.

# General Classification

You hear these terms often. These are general blockchain terms.

* You are a retail crypto-trader: does not affect you that much
* You are a developer: affects you depending on what are you building
* You are a regulator: affects you depending on what you want to regulate

# 1) Layer 1

Layer 1 is just the base layer.

If you imagine there's blockchain has different a kind of blocks this is basic layer 1 as in a tech stack and then on top, you could have another kind of systems, processes and technological stack.

**Crypto Examples:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot. These are different kinds of layer 1 solutions and you could build things on top of them.

**Tech world examples:** IMAP protocol to send your email from [gmail.com](http://gmail.com/) to [yahoo.com](http://yahoo.com/).

**Why is the distinction important?** The economics involved in layer one is very different from the economics of layer 2 and the other kind of layers.

## 2) Layer 2

If layer 1 is the base layer, layer 2 is something that's being built upon it. Layer 2 is usually the scalable solutions and that helps transactions faster.

Layer 1 is good. The objective is to send data in a distributed way and to make sure the other attacks don't happen. That's security. And usually, it means to sacrifice scalability. Layer 2 solves this.

**Crypto Examples:** Lightning network, Plasma chain, and zk-Rollups.

**Tech world examples:** 5G vs 2G

**Why is layer 2 important?** It helps with mainstream adoption for other digital products and services that need speed.

## 3) Dapp

Dapps are decentralised applications. They can be related to finance (DeFi), esports (usually NFT), art (also NFT). They are built on top of Layer 1 or Layer 2. These are applications that you can use.

**Crypto Examples:** Yearn, Nexus Mutual, and Axie Infinity

**Tech world examples:** iOS/Andriod is Layer 1. Instagram app, Telegram app, and web broswer are Dapp.

**Why is Dapp important?** You can hold $ETH or $BTC or $DOT. There's nothing much you can do with it. Dapps are applications where you can have more use-cases with your tokens.

# DeFi General Terms

Another set of terms you hear often. These are general finance terms specific to crypto.

* You are a retail crypto-trader: affects you. Basically your bread and butter.
* You are a developer: affects you depending on what are you building.
* You are a regulator: affects you depending on what you want to regulate.

## 4) DeFi

DeFi: decentralised finance.

DeFi looks to reduce intermediaries in the financial space by decentralising the operations. That is different from the capital market, aka traditional (centralised) finance. Sometimes, that is known as TradFi or CeFi.

**What will be decentralised?** The entire governance mechanism and technology layer will be completely decentralised. And the beginning for DeFi was Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer currency.

Now the cryptocurrency space has grown a bit more. We have lending platforms, d-exchanges, derivatives, insurance and the aggregators. So, decentralised finance has developed a lot of things beyond just p2p lending and Bitcoin.

**DeFi Examples:** P2P currency and technology to remove double-spending

**CeFi examples:** Currency issued by the central bank

**Why is DeFi important?** It opens up financial access to everyone without intermediaries.

## 5) Money Lego

Go back to being a child. You are playing with Lego. You can stack them up and create different types of Lego structure.

Now you are an adult. You play with a different type of Lego. It's money Lego. That means the various technological pieces as lego bricks to build new financial product or infrastructure.

More specifically, it is to combine various products (lending, exchange, options, insurance) and connect them to other products.

For Example, we have ETH and want to trade/hedge. So that, we can mortgage ETH on Compound to receive DAI and transfer DAI to a pool on Uniswap to buy more ETH. Or we can go to derivatives platform and hedge our positions. This is Money Lego that you can stack many types of protocols.

**DeFi Examples:** Collateralise ETH on Compound to borrow DAI (lending) and exchange it for Cream (exchange) and use Cream to stake in various liquidity pools to get an annualised return.

**CeFi world examples:** A similar example is Repo.

**Why is Money Lego important?** This allows for each protocol to specialise in a specific financial instrument and allow anyone to use them as a tool to create new products.

## 6) Composability

Composability is a systems design principle. A protocol can be broken down by different functions and its functions can be used for other purposes. Compostability is very similar to Money Lego.

Different protocols are created with specific purposes, but you can use their functions to achieve your goals.

For example, you can combine the loan functionality of Compound + exchange from Uniswap and provide liquidity on Sushiswap = to create a decentralised derivative exchange with one click. Instead of building everything from scratch.
