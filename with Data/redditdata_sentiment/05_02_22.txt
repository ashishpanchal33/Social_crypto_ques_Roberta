And definitely don't use BinanceUS because it's not the same as classic Binance. Binance is great, BinanceUS isn't. 

Yesterday, Coinbase had [some troubles](https://twitter.com/CoinbaseSupport/status/1489662902688755717) and for a lot of users their platform didn't work. This was happening when the market was moving upwards, so that sucked for people who wanted to take some profits. I can't think of anytime when this happened on Binance.

I'm aware that Binance has some regulatory issues going on in some countries, and that they are not friends with the governments, but besides that, why do people treat it like an exchange that's not trustworthy and completely secure? 

For example, they had a major security compromise in 2019 where some hackers stole around 40 million dollars worth of crypto from users. Guess what? Binance covered the stolen money out of their pocket to ensure the users didn’t lose any funds and since then, there hasn't been any additional compromises. A portion of all the fees Binance takes is placed into this fund called SAFU in case of a financial loss to their users. Any money lost by their users due to Binance would be refunded by their SAFU funds. 

Check that in comparison to how Coinbase does things: [Coinbase terrible customer service after hackers drain user accounts](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/coinbase-slammed-for-terrible-customer-service-after-hackers-drain-user-accounts.html) 

Let's talk about fees. Binance has trading fees lower than 0.1% vs Coinbase's 0.50%. Bank transfers are free on Binance vs 1.5% on Coinbase.

Number of cryptocurrencies supported: Binance has more than 500 cryptocurrencies supported vs 107 for Coinbase.

Staking: Binance has the highest APYs of all exchanges I've seen, and it supports staking for almost every coin that is PoS. It's an incredible place to earn passive income on your crypto and get paid daily. 

The charts: Are you a chart watcher? Then Binance got you. Charts on pretty much every exchange app suck really bad, but the ones on Binance are always on point, aren't laggy and look great. You don't need an additional app like TradingView for charts if you use Binance.

So why are people hesitant on recommending Binance as a great exchange?

In conclusion, the pros outweigh the cons by far for Binance. You can't go wrong with this exchange, and personally I recommend it to everyone that wants to have their life easier in the crypto space."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4450123|public|self|Binance is an exceptional exchange and I'm tired of people that are trying to make it look bad because of it regulatory issues|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sldayr/binance_is_an_exceptional_exchange_and_im_tired/|all_ads|6|1644065489.0|EXCHANGES|38a8ac5a-9d5c-11e5-a136-0e9f3a832fc3|EXCHANGES|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'NMwp3VxopSNJB-kvfaaITYILJHBxM9oVVdhw0QUrFnw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jdsnZjSMyZChPtHDKdG_KZVJxJSmYpaB4KGOMguwKqI.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e014a1fab1198fa3b9c64cf8fed90367daa9ddc', 'width': 108}], 'source': {'height': 73, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jdsnZjSMyZChPtHDKdG_KZVJxJSmYpaB4KGOMguwKqI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=74ad676fcd39442b8ee618d6f0704c7bd89c759b', 'width': 140}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||2022-02-05 18:21:29+00:00|t3_sldayr|0|26|0.63||4||[]|False|False|[]||new||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||05_02_22|02_22|0.12868376|0.4246554|0.44666085|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.1379556953907013|0.35149896144866943|0.01769876293838024|0.2853624224662781|0.1942172795534134|0.013266895897686481

No...it is not ETH or ADA or SOL. 
It is Stellar and Ripple by a huge margin.
What about adoption? 
It seems that big players prefer projects with ""corporate"" governance. Almost as if they prefer to work with ""their own"" kind!








We know for a fact that centralized networks are much more vulnerable to majority attacks. 
Don't corporate know about it? Ofc they do. But they don't fear it as long as they have insurance from developers. They are not us! They will have fair and safe contracts and a legal team to defend their investment if developers don't deliver.








Following current pattern I predict that Hedera will be one of the biggest players in cryptomarket.
It is everything Ripple and Stellar are with a much better technology and it is literally owned by a huge corporate counsel. And I knew this for a while but just couldn't bring myself to invest in their project. Even tho I am sure it is a great investment. It just doesn't feel right.










What am I trying to say? I guess my point is there will be two different roads, two different space, maybe even two ""definition"" for success in cryptomarket soon enough. 
There will be Defi , and it most likely will suffer short term from all the federal shit...
and there will be them. And by them I mean any project owned by big corporations. And they will be much safer to invest...








Time will come when people show their true color, true intentions for being in here, and if this is only to make money as some of you say then corporates have allrdy won.

Bitquery had an address that showed it was from tornado cash.  My question is, what's a tumbler, what reason does somone have to use a tumbler,  This transaction was 2 eth but I still find the concept interesting. And how does it work,   

Also how do these things work? I can picture many accounts move if money between but surely the eth gas fees make it unviable. 

Finally is somthing like tornado cash legal? Surely money laundering and other illicit things will use this tool. I noticed a lot of articles referring to this exactly as well.

Thanks to this great sun, 
And Thanks for helping me learn more :)"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4447274|public|self|Question after exploring bitquery.|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/skullq/question_after_exploring_bitquery/|all_ads|6|1644005036.0|DISCUSSION|87049662-0882-11e5-82e1-0e9d1a9f7761|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2022-02-05 01:33:56+00:00|t3_skullq|0|2|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||new||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||05_02_22|02_22|0.10729484|0.51154906|0.38115624|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.04357043653726578|0.2632427215576172|0.019270893186330795|0.24591293931007385|0.4173935651779175|0.010609447956085205

Actually exists a way to bridge to Arbitrum for less than 10$ in gas fees. For doing this you need a Crypto.com account (or a Binance.com account, basically any exchange which allows L2 withdrawals, but the fees are lower on crypto.com)

So the way to do this is really easy:

#Procedure:

First, send your ethereum to your crypto.com account, gas fee = ~6.29$ right now.

Second, withdraw your eth to your Arbitrum L2 address, exchange fee = 0.001eth = ~3$.

And that is all, fool proof. The future is L2, and Arbitrum fees will lower even more after their Nitro upgrade which is coming the next days.

If you’re thinking about trying L2, this is actually a good first step. The only inconvenience is that you need an exchange account, but if you use crypto, chances of having one are high"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4450097|public|self|How to bridge ETH to L2 for less than 10$|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sld7jy/how_to_bridge_eth_to_l2_for_less_than_10/|all_ads|6|1644064865.0|ADVICE|e9570888-9c2a-11e3-809c-12313d1661cc|ADVICE|||||||||||2022-02-05 18:11:05+00:00|t3_sld7jy|0|15|0.89||0||[]|False|False|[]||new||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||05_02_22|02_22|0.08798095|0.4706187|0.44140035|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.05708480626344681|0.21451924741268158|0.014078743755817413|0.21398550271987915|0.4815766215324402|0.01875513233244419

I have wallets all over the place currently. Trust, Gemini, KuCoin,  CB, CB Pro, etc. I have a tendency to lose 2 factor authentications all the time. I break a lot of phones and always seem to lose them. (I just lost my 2FA for Discord this week and now I have to restart my account.) Is there a good cold wallet or alternative that I can swap to for some peace of mind? Is  the Ledger good? I just want it all consolidated into one place. I don't day trade or anything, I'm just in for the long run. Any ideas would be appreciated!

I found this drastic even the hardware wallets being susceptible to the non- win 7 updates. I run Avira basic, and know that's not the most protective but I am careful about what I do. A lot of wallets were made and quickly removed afterwords as extensions and what not, so they aren't on the computer at all (some wallets were made because hardware wallets were not compatible with them at the time).

Our team have however taken time to study and fund that one aspect of human needs is also in need of urgent attention; the issue of lack of or limited access to proper and nourishing food items which has become a problem for the ever growing human population.

The Problem 
The high cost of healthy diets coupled with persistent high levels of income inequality put healthy diets out of reach for around 3 billion people, especially the poor, in every region of the world in 2019. This number is slightly less than in 2017 and will likely increase in most regions in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Shifting to healthy diets that include sustainability considerations can contribute to reducing health and climate change costs by 2030, because the hidden costs of these diets are lower compared with those of current consumption patterns. 

Our Solutions 
1. Intervening along the food supply chains to lower the cost of nutritious foods. 2. Tackling poverty and structural inequalities, ensuring interventions are pro-poor and inclusive. 3. Strengthening food environments and changing consumer behaviour to promote dietary patterns with positive impacts on human health and the environment."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4447010|public|self|using Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to fight food insecurity|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sksn78/using_blockchain_technology_and_cryptocurrency_to/|all_ads|6|1643999825.0|UPDATE|0de51794-8fa8-11eb-8c8b-0e387731294b|PROJECT-UPDATE|||||||||||2022-02-05 00:07:05+00:00|t3_sksn78|0|2|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||new||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||05_02_22|02_22|0.09146045|0.4741921|0.43434742|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.035742782056331635|0.11643794178962708|0.013254957273602486|0.7067638635635376|0.11938688904047012|0.008413459174335003

**1/ Don't put in money that you need within a year.**  

And please don't put in your life savings.  Crypto is VERY volatile. You need to have a long-term mindset to avoid panic selling at the bottom.  

**2/ Manage your wallets well**  

* Don't give out your seed phrase - especially not to official-sounding ""support"" emails and DMs.
* Buy a hardware wallet. The \~$100 is nothing compared to the thousands that you could lose  
* Don't put all your assets in one wallet

**3/ Start with BTC and ETH**  

These are ""boring"" but relatively safer crypto assets.  

* Altcoins (e.g., Solana, Terra, AVAX) are more risky  
* NFTs are both more risky AND more illiquid  

Don't get sucked into the latest trending thing without doing your research.

**4/ Use L2 / non-eth L1 chains to learn crypto and save gas costs** 

It is worth moving a small amount to L2 and other L1 chains to learn crypto while saving thousands on gas.  Try Polygon or Solana for your first NFT or DeFi transaction. Do your research first though.

**5/ Ok but how do you actually do your research?**  

* Understand the project's value prop  
* Look up the founders  
* Check the community's vibes  
* Talk to smart people or search Twitter threads 

Now let's close with some thoughts on FOMO...

**6/ Don't FOMO into rapidly rising prices**  

Let's say some coin or NFT project is pumping.   People on Twitter keep talking about it. The charts are mooning.  At this point, you're probably too late.  Most likely you'll be holding the bag as early investors exit.

**7/ Don't FOMO into crazy APYs** 

If you're playing around with DeFi, you'll come across crazy APYs (1,000%+).  Try to understand WHY the APY is so high first before doing anything.  

**8/ Don't leverage**  

Leverage means borrowing some crypto to invest in other crypto.  If you're a beginner, just don't do it.  You have no idea what you're doing, and leveraging is the quickest way to get liquidated.

**9/ One last thing - get educated.**  

Yes, the best way to learn in crypto is to just do stuff.  But try to understand what you're doing first.

They also apparently took photos and video of the whole ordeal.

I remember Facebook also saying that they will include a ""protective bubble"" around your avatar as an option, I wonder what happened to that.

In any case, expect to see stories like this play out. I was an avid MW2 player so nothing fazes me online. In fact as a kid, I use to laugh whenever some idiot decided to t bag my soldier.

For example, if I click receive on trustwallet for Cardano , (I'm not even sure this is the correct procedure for transferring yet, just want to figure out this different version thing first so I select the right token) it shows cardanobep2 (ADA), binance -peg (ADA)  Bep20, ADA boy, FEG wrappedBEP 20, Aave DAI ERC 20, etc... Im assuming the one I need to use is cardano bep2?

 How do i know which one to use. Some of them are the same looking symbol/logo like Polkadot which has polkadot(dot), binance dot (BDOT), venus dot(Vdot). If I just make sure the ticker symbol is the same as the one on coinbase, I should be good right, but some, (not many) have the same on that also like ADA with the first two i listed. I will try with a small amount at first just out of fear of making a mistake.

The way I see it Cexs' bring many advantages such as:

1. Safe and secured, at least in the UK my money is insured and supported so even if the exchange is hacked I don't lose a thing and if they go into bankruptcy there's still a chance of some/all my      investments to be returned.
2. Staking coins, one click of a button and I get 5-20% yearly returns on my stash which is a overlooked but extremely generous risk free 'interest' return.
3. Does what I want it to do, buy coins, HODL, sell coins (profit optional).

So with these in mind what can Defi offer me to maximise our gains further?  
 

I should also add, not interested in the whole 'not your keys not your coins' argument, I don't need the exact same coin returned to me when I move it elsewhere, another of equal value is fine the same way I don't expect the same fiat notes back from the bank when I use an ATM."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4450130|public|self|DEFI people please convince all of us long time CEX users of what we're actually missing out on|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sldfg5/defi_people_please_convince_all_of_us_long_time/|all_ads|6|1644066039.0|DISCUSSION|87049662-0882-11e5-82e1-0e9d1a9f7761|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2022-02-05 18:30:39+00:00|t3_sldfg5|0|22|0.83||0||[]|False|True|[]||new||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||05_02_22|02_22|0.06340579|0.49510497|0.44148928|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.08904828876256943|0.15009088814258575|0.0093326261267066|0.4671396017074585|0.2762399911880493|0.008148635737597942

They're pointless. They may have other uses in the future, but those don't really improve the current status quo...etc.

Is there any project that is as far ahead as cargox in terms of implementation of NFTs for real world use cases? I can't think of any other examples...

When people debate NFTs they beg for examples that show real world use cases. Even the most staunch defender of NFTs will never mention Cargox or Bill of lading documents. Its the perfect example! It's what everyone on the planet is wondering! This is a real world use case for NFTs that improves the current process. It's faster. Cheaper. More secure. This project should be a beacon of light for the crypto community. It should be the go-to example when people debate NFTs. It ticks all the boxes. And this is happening now. It's being implemented daily. Its already begun in Egypt with digitising bill of lading documents. And they want to expand the tech to handle financial documents. India and the Middle East are interested.

This isn't as sexy or interesting as other use cases, but that's because it's grounded in reality. It's handling the behind the scenes shit that no one pays attention to.

Students are the untapped potential of the crypto market and once they get a proper introduction into crypto the potential is limitless. 

Classes teaching crypto and a better understanding of finances, and how the economy works, trading etc... Would all be greatly beneficial to them since most students are forging this path that's filled with unknowns so crypto can be a launchpad to start from. 

Spaces for students to create and share their crypto ideas and going into their own personal investments which would help them cover finances, student debt and a lot of other expenses that college students struggle with through crypto. Projects like EduDAO are doing just that, and they're part of the BitDAO ecosystem which is focusing in big part on education.

People get too excited by market action that they take massive risks and go all out, ruining their portfolio in the process. 

There’s a reason it is said that you should be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. Because when the market tends for the sentiment of greed, everything takes massive attacks. Either up or down. Everything changes really fast. But when people are fearful they tend to be careful and wary, their investments become calculated and studied and they take well above and beyond time to study their investments. This would be the best time for you to buy and hold. 

There’s a pattern, that you will see soon .When people get too distracted with crypto and bitcoin, the NFT market will get stale and slow down, and when this happens this will be your chance, your one, and only, opportunity. 

When this happens, I, believe that that would be a good time to buy and accumulate, NFTs. I am currently researching good platforms to start holding NFTs, yes unironically. For example, someone suggested to me the usage of Yunometa to buy and hold and I am seriously considering it.

But claiming that crypto as a whole is a scam actually represents an unaccepted level of low financial education. I mean it’s definitely unfair to compare this market to the stock market or to forex or to any other form of financial markets, simply because crypto isn’t even 20 years old lol. 

Not to forget that we’ve got projects worth billions of dollars being invested here, and aiming to grow and to add to the crypto scene as a whole. For example, BitDAO is literally investing more than $2 billions in web3 and DeFi. So you think that this kind of projects is going to be investing in this space because it’s a scam.

Also crypto is presenting to the world a new kind of technology that will be changing the entire understanding of internet.

I saw it on twitter the other day and it got my attention. Is it good? The idea behind is the community votes in a DAO to choose the project to invest in, then it gets bought from the project's treasury.
 As the DAO makes a profit, you get part of that paid in reflections, while the rest goes into the treasury for more investing. I looked at the roadmap and it seems pretty good and solid with clear milestones that can be checked if it is done or not.

 And by looking at their tokenomics I think it's pretty sustainable for the project in the long run and would help their token from fluctuating.

While the market was down i researched many DeFi projects that got huge potential and I'm here today to tell you about my favorite find. It is called Aggregated Finance and its community powered investing. 


The way it works is simple: you first head over to Uniswap and get yourself some $AGFI. After that, you can go to the Aggregated Finance dashboard and connect your wallet. From there you have access to all the great features it has to offer. 

You will get to vote in a DAO on what project to buy from multiple DeFi 3.0 projects and yield earning. 

Then it gets bought from the treasury and part of the profit gets distributed to token holders as reflections.

Not interested in bitcoin as my PC can't handle it, need to know of some good cryptocurrency that is easy to mine solo, and the profits can come directly to my bank or paypal account. I'm fine getting slow and steady growth as long as i earn money without 3rd parties involved and can upgrade my current rig which is as follows,  

i7 6700k 

GTX970

16GB DDR4 RAM 
 
750w PSU

120GB SSD

1TB HDD  

I think this is way too old, but the circumstances only got right recently, so my first priority is raising steady funds for a new PC, then i will go to mine higher currencies though not bitcoin that ship has sailed for most people who aren't mega rich.  

I want safe currencies only and to know ways to mine and transfer money to my bank with the only parties involved being me and the currency maker.   

Don't want to break my PC by mining strain as i don't have money for a new one. So help me out knowing that.  

PS - Let me know if the mining depends on where i live and other factors affecting location.

In 2018, Visa felt that Bitcoin was not a payment system, and not worthy of their time. To them, during that period, Bitcoin was not a means of payment and merely a fad. This makes me remember how many companies felt NFTs would go out of trend, but see them today. Many of them are falling over NFTs after they have seen the success of existing projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Goku. 

In 2021, Visa stated that they were working on enabling bitcoin purchases. Who would have thought that they would have changed their words so fast?

Whether you buy in today or not, you will have to own it in the future. So why not buy in now and lend yourself the advantage of time. Why not give yourself the power?

Why must we let go of these changes will we drown our minds in mind-boggling time-wasting brain-numbing activates on the day-to-day? Do you like your 9-to-5? Is this the life you want for yourself? Would the teen version of you be proud of the man you are today? 

Take chances while they are here, they won’t be here for long. You can now buy everything for cheap, so just f ing do it. Get yourself a bag of something and grip it tight until the end.

It’s one of the most growing spaces in the crypto market, and investors actually realized that. For example if we look at the market cap of DeFi projects in the past few years, we can easily tell that these projects are on the rise. 

Obviously, we’re still far from the best, and there still is a big room for improvement, which is why we are seeing a lot of DeFi-based projects working on growing this scene even more, and they’re actually doing so, like Baanx for example, which aims to bridge DeFi to real world finance.

So it’s a matter of time before we get to see the best of decentralized finance.

This means the obvious, therefore all cryptocurrencies go up and it becomes more expensive to buy.

I don't care if coins are worth pennies instead of thousands of dollars; I'll still support and invest in crypto if and when it becomes more affordable.
The Ethereum blockchain is the most active in terms of live applications, with more being developed and refined all the time. Because its mission is to create a new economy, the importance of applications is critical. Listed below are a few examples:
As a result, if you're looking for an undervalued cryptocurrency to invest in this year, I've put together some of the best options. Some of the products to look for include Algorand, polkadot, and Bob Eco Coin. All of these organisations are diverse in their fields, with strong teams and an openness to new ideas. As a result, we should keep an eye out for good projects like these.
People are gravitating toward cause-based projects, which are referred to as utility-based tokens in the crypto world, as adoption grows. Bob Eco Coin, the first of its kind in the ev sector, is one such project to keep an eye on.

 It's the first time a for-profit social enterprise has been tokenized in the world. It is a type of security token that has both equity and assets backing it.

I’m serious when I say this and I know I’m not the only one who believes this. I can’t believe how cringe they’ve become, even more than they already were before. Matter of fact, after their unapologetic entry in the crypto market, their cringe has reached astronomical levels.

I mean seriously, are they even selling these NFTs that they are shilling? I would imagine even if someone was interested in their NFT they would get lost in a sea of angry and rowdy fans in the comment section. This is such a bad idea. I mean why not just use a dedicated platform just for celebrity NFTs? I heard Yunometa was working on making this a thing. Good. That way said celebrities can approach their target demographic appropriately and the celebrity can sell their work. And the target audience would get their fix. 

Someone should tell them how bad what they’re currently doing, for their image, and that the replacements presents now could fix it for them and for all of us too.

People won't be confused about which metaverse to spend their time in because the metaverses will be divided into categories based on their primary features and offerings.

Some metaverses, such as alienworlds, may just support adventure, where people go to get their kick and spend some time adventuring. Now, some people may not want to participate in this frenzy and instead prefer a peaceful 2nd life in the metaverse.

Similarly, Metakawn, a project aimed at the Muslim community, as well as nfts in terms of their community. This is the First Metaverse for modern Muslims who share the same values in a Halal EcoSystem. Instead of relying on brand sponsorship and/or social media networks, a platform that allows Muslim creators to earn a fair living from their community.

So in my conclusion different metaverses may exist for various purposes in our daily lives, ranging from gaming to community.

Like crypto, the NFT space has witnessed rapid adoption from large corporations. Disney recently stated that it was going to get involved in the NFT space and to do that, it was hiring experts in the field to navigate their development. 
Disney feels that they have a lot of copyrighted materials that could benefit from the concept of NFTs. They may end up earning extra streams of income from this. 
Nintendo is the latest company that is offering to integrate NFTs into its operation. With the way they are all announcing their interests in NFTs, one would think that it was today NFT was created. 

Anyway, I am not surprised. They have seen the success of existing projects like BAYC and Goku, and want to benefit from it."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|727338|public|self|Nintendo: We are interested in the metaverse and NFTs and feel their potential|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/sl39uj/nintendo_we_are_interested_in_the_metaverse_and/|all_ads|6|1644034471.0|discussion|d990f59a-aa4d-11e3-bb1c-12313d053130|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2022-02-05 09:44:31+00:00|t3_sl39uj|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||05_02_22|02_22|0.11630854|0.45205623|0.4316354|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07758814096450806|0.24844463169574738|0.020637458190321922|0.3100588023662567|0.3177177309989929|0.02555321902036667

The metaverse is a virtual environment accessible via all digital devices that exists on the internet. It's a gigantic three-dimensional space with the same levels of complexity as the real world.

People expect to have a good time in these virtual environments. People expect it to be a place where they can feel more liberated, where they can do whatever they want without fear of being judged by others. They also expect it to be free of crime, poverty, pollution, and anything else that might make people feel unsafe or uneasy in real life.

The Metaverse is generating a lot of buzz, with many technology companies claiming to be Metaverse companies or creating Metaverses to enhance or augment people's digital and physical realities. Furthermore, activities that are currently carried out in separate environments will eventually be brought together in a single Metaverse, such as:

•	Purchasing outfits and accessories for online avatars
•	Buying digital land and constructing virtual homes
•	Participating in a virtual social experience
•	Shopping in virtual malls via immersive commerce
•	Using virtual classrooms to experience immersive learning
•	Buying digital art, collectibles and assets (NFTs)

Some people will want their own private community or something with specific rules, while others will be dissatisfied with decentraland and sandbox because they are primarily used for marketing and creating hype. Other metaverse projects, such as Alienworlds, are also in the works. It's a metaverse adventure game, or there could be community-based metaverses like metakawn, which is a project aimed at the Muslim community, and nfts, which is a community-based metaverse.

I know many people, especially on here, are losing their sh. And, honestly, it’s pretty funny to watch. I can’t believe everyone here is losing their goddamn minds over a small dip in the market rather than buy the dip like they always claim. 

I’ve literally seen it here a billion times, saying how you will buy every dip that ever arrives. All of you claimed the dip will be the next buy opportunity, yet the dip is here and all of you are nowhere to be seen. Where’s that courage you were flaunting now?

I literally don’t understand this. You kept waiting for the chance yet, you won’t take it. It’s not about getting chances, it’s about taking them damn it. 

I’ll take every chance I can get thank you very much. I will use this dip to buy into my NFTs, a bunch of friends and I are considering pooling our money and buying an ape, or maybe even a Royal Falcon once they go live. 

This is an opportunity, you were asking for it, now do the best of it.

**TLDR**:

The above article has pointed out the problems that DeFI is facing and new projects are solving them. Effective capital is still the top priority of DeFi 2.0 today, that is, trading volume on TVL (DEX) or Outstanding Loan on Total Lending (Lending/Borrowing) must be higher.

We also have to redefine what a protocol is and how effective it is, and if it does, it will give DeFi access to more funding in the future.

# General Conclusion

Recently the keyword “DeFi 2.0” has emerged as a phenomenon along with the rapid growth of several tokens such as Olympus DAO, Klim DAO, Abracadabra, Popsicle Finance, etc. So what is DeFi 2.0? How is it different? Why say DeFi 2.0 has the ability to change the entire DeFi today? And what will we need to prepare for the coming giant wave?

&gt;DeFi 1.0 is the straight-forward simple things like ""I give you $150 worth of ETH. You give me $100 worth of crypto USD.  
&gt;  
&gt;DeFi 2.0 is more risk understanding. Instead of $150 worth of ETH, maybe just $110 worth of ETH or $150 alt-TOKEN to get the same $100 crypto USD.

How is it different from ""DeFi 1.0""? Well.... it's not so different. Similar mechanisms but with higher risk tolerance.

# DeFi 2.0

DeFi is a decentralised finance (or open finance), by leveraging the power of blockchain, DeFi has made it possible for anyone to access and use financial applications anywhere, anytime. not subject to the control of individuals or organisations with centralised power.

However, DeFi currently has many limitations and as the name suggests, DeFi 2.0 is an upgraded version of DeFi, helping to overcome the weaknesses and optimise the advantages of current DeFi. Thereby opening up great potential opportunities for the parties involved.

## Current DeFi Limitation

To understand the problems that DeFi 2.0 solves, we must first know what the problems of DeFi are, the prominent limitations of DeFi include:

* Scalability: Expensive gas fees, long waiting times greatly affect the user experience.
* Liquidity: Liquidity is considered the blood of any trading market, and with DeFi, liquidity is generally low.
* Centralisation: DeFi will not make sense without the word ""De"", although DeFi aims at decentralisation, but with many projects at the present time, the power still belongs to a small part (still remains).
* Security: DeFi is a market with a lot of risks, security in DeFi has not really received much attention compared to their importance.
* Oracle Attack: DeFi depends a lot on Oracle, but many projects still do not understand and underestimate the choice of Oracle to integrate. As a result, the project suffered a lot from related attacks.
* Capital Efficiency: DeFi with many breakthroughs from technology has helped users use capital more effectively, but at the moment, there is a large amount of assets that are still underutilised. opens up many new development potentials for DeFi."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|727865|public|self|What Is DeFi 2.0: An Intro|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/slji7a/what_is_defi_20_an_intro/|all_ads|6|1644082766.0|discussion|d990f59a-aa4d-11e3-bb1c-12313d053130|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2022-02-05 23:09:26+00:00|t3_slji7a|0|2|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||05_02_22|02_22|0.09943512|0.50272423|0.39784065|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0823168158531189|0.11424129456281662|0.01224549487233162|0.49923110008239746|0.2819773554801941|0.009987949393689632

Think of the Metaverse as a virtual world on the internet where you can do practically everything you can do in the physical world. You can own properties, sell properties, buy clothing, attend concerts and parties etc. 

For brands seeking to expand their business into the Metaverse, there is a world of opportunities therein. Businesses can now create virtual versions of their products and sell them to interested customers on the Metaverse. To be able to adequately leverage on this opportunity, it is advantageous to partner with platforms like Suku.world. These platforms have the required infrastructure and tools that allow for optimized customer engagement on the Metaverse.

Ethereum rival Cardano announced yet another update for its blockchain network. Cardano’s development studio Input-Output Global shared the details of the upgrade. These updates cater to Cardano’s consensus structure and data process specifications.  


The Cardano team will monitor the network performance just as the consensus enters the Basho stage. This stage is also about decentralization as well as the scalability of transaction processing for DApps and wallets.  


I am currently struggling with ETH but this news reminded me that I recently discovered a new platform that offers, among other things, benefits related to the transaction, price, and speed, and one of those platforms is Metis, I will probably try it out.  


A friend of mine who is using Metis also told me that Metis is amazing because it is solving problems that ETH has, such as  
simplicity, scalability also and things like storage, security, and savings. I think that is a perfect solution. It would be great if some of you share your experience with Metis, I've heard only the best things."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|727745|public|self|This is good news for all Cardano owners, don't you think?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/sleyxe/this_is_good_news_for_all_cardano_owners_dont_you/|all_ads|6|1644070270.0|discussion|d990f59a-aa4d-11e3-bb1c-12313d053130|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2022-02-05 19:41:10+00:00|t3_sleyxe|0|10|0.85||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||05_02_22|02_22|0.1058338|0.4481893|0.44597685|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.06887347251176834|0.13158805668354034|0.01260214764624834|0.5141336917877197|0.26247766613960266|0.010325027629733086
