The value of Token originates from the resources consumed by mining rather than the concept of ideology. This is the current status. Miners choose to mine because of the existence of benefits, rather than contributing charity to the circulation of Token.

From the perspective of the blockchain, the continuous improvement of the consensus mechanism has the greatest impact on the incentive layer, so the consensus mechanism determines how to mine.

The essence of the blockchain is a ledger. It does not bring its own decentralized attributes. Only when a consensus mechanism is added can the blockchain achieve decentralization.

The distributed existence of nodes allows rights to return to individuals, and each node verifies transactions, and the object is a consistent ledger, so there is no conflict. The existence of a consensus mechanism is to solve the problem of ledger consistency.

In fact, it can be more simply understood that the consensus mechanism is a rule that everyone can recognize, and everyone can follow this rule so that everyone can get a fair return.

Since the creation of BTC, the consensus mechanism has also gone through 10 years. Although more than 30 consensus mechanisms have appeared in these 10 years, in general, there are only a few mainstream consensuses in the crypto world.

1. POW-Proof of Work
2. POS-Proof of Stake
3. DPOS-Delegated Proof of Stake
4. POC-Proof of Capacity

**Origin of consensus mechanism**

The POW is that more work can get more distribution. High-intensity decentralization has given it high security, but its inefficient transaction and the huge amount of energy consumed by mining have always been criticized, and the mining pool will still lead to centralization after it has mastered most of the computing power.

A group of farmers who only have sickle, whoever contributes more, whoever gets more, everyone has the right to participate in meetings and elections, and everyone has the right to speak. However, the efficiency of using only a sickle to work is extremely low, so some farmers began to buy machines to work, but the price of the machines is very expensive, not everyone can afford, so the farmers who have machines at home will get more returns.

**Development of consensus mechanism**

PoS is to obtain the right to package the block by staking tokens. During the transaction process, the system rewards the nodes that package and verify the block. The source of the reward is additional or unlock of the token.

POW is that compares the computing power to obtain the block's bookkeeping right, while POS compares the number of coins held by the miner to obtain the block's bookkeeping right. The more coins the miner holds, the more likely it is to obtain the bookkeeping right. Bigger. The whole process will not involve calculations and will not waste resources, shorten the time to reach consensus, significantly increase the speed of transactions, and at the same time, shortcomings will begin to appear, such as weakened decentralization and security issues.

Everyone is a farmer with sickles. As a result, someone suddenly bought a machine to work, and the efficiency and income improved. The farmers became rich farmers. Therefore, at the meeting, the rich farmers had a clearer voice than ordinary farmers.

**Improvement of consensus mechanism**

On the basis of POS, a DPOS has appeared, which is similar to the representative system. The token holders are elected as nodes, and then the nodes vote for selection, and then supernodes are generated, and these supernodes are responsible for verification and registration so that they get rewards. This approach greatly reduces the number of nodes participating in verification and accounting and improves efficiency and performance again, but in essence, this is inconsistent with the concept of decentralization and belongs to a small range of centralization. The security coefficient is extremely low.

When it comes to elections, not everyone has the right to vote. Instead, the representatives of each village vote and the individual rights are replaced by small groups.

The POC is an algorithm that uses the computer's hard disk space to store mining data to mine for a profit. It generates a large number of pseudo-random numbers through a certain algorithm and then packs these random numbers into hard disk space to compete in the block. When competing rights, miners only need to scan the data in the hard disk space.

Such block generation is determined by the storage density of the hard disk space, which physically limits the generation of blocks, guarantees the security of the blocks, and finally allows the entire blockchain to reach consensus.

Some people have developed a new type of crop. Just plant it in the field, and when it rains there, there can grow crops there. The more farmland, the greater the number and probability of crops growing in the field. Everyone is very happy because the machines are so expensive that ordinary people can't afford them, and now they just have to wait for the rain.

Judging from the development history of mining, as long as the market value of the traditional POW workload proof mechanism reaches a certain level, it will be ASIC. As long as the economic value of Token exists, the ASIC mining machine will always cause a waste of resources and environmental pollution.

In this case, the advantages of the POC algorithm are extremely obvious:

**1. Low threshold for mining, wide audience**

The price of hard disks is low. Everyone can buy one to participate in mining, and the supply of hard disks is stable. This determines that POC mining can participate at any time, regardless of the time of participation.

**2. High mining efficiency and low energy consumption**

Compared with CPU, GPU, and ASIC mining machines, the hard disks used for POC hard disk mining have an average power consumption of only 8 \~ 14W. Lower electricity costs allow miners to earn more, which is one of the reasons why more and more POW miners participate in POC hard disk mining.

**3. Ecological development is more** **positive**

Traditional POW miners will have to sell tokens more or less because of electricity bills. In the POC, electricity bills are extremely low and the existence of a mortgage mechanism will allow miners to hold tokens for higher returns, the miners become an ecological builder, which avoids the project failure caused by the early miners who obtained a large number of tokens at a very low cost to sell in bulk.

Currently, there are very few currencies mined based on the POC consensus algorithm. Recently, the more popular Diskcoin has been developing steadily and continuously under the circumstances of a bad environment. This also proves the stubborn vitality of the POC currency from the side. Even though the current POC crypto market is generally underperforming, I still believe that the emergence of POC hard disk mining is to give ordinary people a chance to get rich, and Diskcoin is a good choice!"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|953256|public|self|POC - Changing Consensus with Hard disk|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/eg4lt9/poc_changing_consensus_with_hard_disk/|all_ads|6|1577392036.0|NEW-COIN|118ffec0-a22f-11e5-a5a1-0ef58894b98d|NEW-COIN|||||||||||2019-12-27 01:57:16+00:00|t3_eg4lt9|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]|[]|||||||||||||||||||||27_12_19|12_19|0.10915295|0.46025336|0.43059373|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.11234278976917267|0.24177832901477814|0.022663366049528122|0.41518980264663696|0.1914137303829193|0.016611939296126366

One of the main FUDs this sub likes to talk about is LN as if Satoshi didn't want this to be created. WRONG.  
 Satoshi said this in 2010 - ""The design outlines a lightweight client that does not need the full block chain. In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification. The lightweight client can send and receive transactions, it just can't generate blocks. It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself. The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed. For now, everyone just runs a full network node."" If you don't see how this is the LN that Satoshi anticipated than you might be delusional.  
  
To further digress on that a bit - ""I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less. It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in. The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions."" He already knew most people will be using the second layer.  
  
The second biggest FUD would be the block size. The 'satoshivision' fan boys claim that it was apart of Satoshi's vision to not bring out innovation and stick to the bitcoin core client and increase it's blocksize when needed however this is also wrong.  
-""The threshold can easily be changed in the future. We can decide to increase it when the time comes. It's a good idea to keep it lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed. If we hit the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual use. Keeping the threshold lower would help limit the amount of wasted disk space in that event.""  Anyone with common sense would acknowledge that the 2017 bull run was just a FLOOD like satoshi mentioned. And it literally was, anyone who was here would recall the Bitcoin network was under heavy attacks and was being spammed by thousands of penny transactions. During all of this drama is when the 'satoshivision fan boys' started coming out trying to call a flipenning. If you don't see how this was a fraudulent attempt to take over, than again you might be delusional. Bitcoin block size did increase by very little but just like satoshi's actual vision, it's been kept low because we don't actually need to increase it. Best to work on innovation than to take the easy route and only increase if ACTUALLY needed and not just because floods are happening.   
  
  
The 3rd major FUD attacks on Bitcoin in this sub is based on the mining. People in this sub really think China will overtake the network which is another delusion.  
-""The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU proof-of-worker than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth."" China would never try to overtake the network. It literally makes no sense. China is about greed and this kind of attack would lose A LOT of money. Not only that, but even if overtaking the network you still can't do anything really! You can't steal anybodies coins. The most you can do is buy something online and than overtake the network so you can double spend and essentially get your money back even though you used it. But you cannot touch anybody's wallets so again it makes zero sense to believe China would ever attempt something like this which makes no sense. All China wants is more money. They will continue to grow there farms essentially making bitcoin stronger.  
  
To digress a bit further - ""There would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to overproof-of-worker the network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins. The smaller farms are then the ""honest nodes"". (I need a better term than ""honest"") The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the bar gets to overproof-of-worker the network, making larger farms also too small to overproof-of-worker it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too. According to the ""long tail"" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put together should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.""   
  
""Even if a bad guy does overproof-of-worker the network, it's not like he's instantly rich. All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent, like bouncing a check. To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overproof-of-worker the network and try to take his money back. I don't think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins.

However the reason for terminating was valid and his account was given back and I think he's one of the most respectable finance people in todays age.  
  
What I noticed over the past year, on nearly every youtube crypto guy, is the comment sections being INFESTED with scammers/impersonators and these impersonators do a really good damn job going as far as having full blown conversations with themselves using other accounts which look legit and even feel legit. Very easy scams to the normies.  
  
I suspect over the past year or so, reports been coming in heavy to youtube forcing them to 'act'.  The action wasn't 100% on point as they mis-banned a lot of people mistaking them for the scammers which in actuality the scammers were in the comment sections.  
  
Whoever is a LEGIT youtuber, if there account was terminated they most likely will get it back. However if any LEGIT youtuber doesn't get his/her account back, Then I would be worried.  
  
  
So how much do we know about legit youtubers being ban? So far it seems like a lot of these so called legit youtubers are shills. They aren't teaching much about the actual technology and they aren't really teaching much about real finance advice and how trading really works. For reference, check out Alessio Rastani's channel.

Or this is the wrong place to post something like this.  Either way, I think I broke the BitZ exchange for TUSD/USDT.  This particular trading pair has been reported on coinmarketcap as having daily volume of over $50m USD.  Watching the charts for a few days fed into that.  I moved some crypto (&lt; $50 USDT) to the site to see if I could buy some TUSD low and sell high.  So, I watched the buy and sell price, and they didn't move, but the ""Trades"" for the pair kept showing buys and sells around where the price marker is at.  I decided to play a little game.  I started making buys just under the lowest trade value, making my way all the way up to a buy higher than the 24-hour high.  I now have a buy for 1.000 TUSD for 1.0085 USDT at 1.0085 and it hasn't been bought in over 30 minutes.  The ""Trades"" have completely stopped.  The klines for the 1-minute graph have completely stopped.  There are sells building at 1.0086, but still no Trades.  I bet if I cancel my buy, the data will fill in, but look at this:

I've tried doing everything in Excel and the process breaks as soon as I try to figure out how to handle holding funds temporarily in a paper wallet. I've tried bitcoin.tax but it says transfers are ignored because they're not taxable events, which is true, but it certainly impacts the calculation of cost basis.

Consider the following examples:

1. I buy Bitcoin in Coinbase, make a few purchases, transfer some funds to a paper wallet, make a few more purchases, buy some more Bitcoin, then sweep the paper wallet and transfer back to Coinbase, and continue making purchases. I need to tell the software, hey, I held these funds in abeyance until this date, but they were actually purchased on this other date.

2. I earn Bitcoin and accumulate the income in an electrum wallet, leave it there for a year, and then transfer to Coinbase and repeat the scenario above.

I have tried Bitcoin.tax, Koinly, Zenledger, and Cointracker and they all seem to force me into what they think is the typical crypto trading scenario and my situation just doesn't fit. I have already been ghosted by professionals who are secretly trying to put it into the same services without any luck. I don't care about exchange apis or wallet monitoring. I know what the events are, I just desperately need some software to help me accurately and manually account for all of this."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|953441|public|self|What tax software supports complicated manual entry and altcoin paper wallets?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/egg2sd/what_tax_software_supports_complicated_manual/|all_ads|6|1577457252.0|SUPPORT||SUPPORT|||||||||||2019-12-27 20:04:12+00:00|t3_egg2sd|0|2|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]|[]|||||||||||||||||||||27_12_19|12_19|0.09943512|0.50272423|0.39784065|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0823168158531189|0.11424129456281662|0.01224549487233162|0.49923110008239746|0.2819773554801941|0.009987949393689632

I also was looking for a similar breakdown before joining the platform myself, so thought it might be helpful to those considering joining. If you have experience using them and have your own thoughts, feel free to chime in.

Review Link: [HERE](https://medium.com/@cryptobuffett/pros-cons-my-experience-using-crypto-com-143566336bf9?sk=8dc1030c185ac5291ea415b606caea2c)

I'll summarize most of my thoughts - I think they have a great product, one of the best app UXs I've had the pleasure of using that trumps the competition (like Celsius). The In-App Support feature is also unrivaled, and blows me away that you can speak to a live-human in app within minutes. The Cashback on the debit card is a nice feature, and tho, I'd personally prefer receiving cash or btc directly as opposed to MCO, it is a great way to increase your exposure passively as you go about your day especially if you believe in CDC and their future.

As far as an all in one ecosystem goes, they've largely succeeded in creating a seamless user experience and having industry-leading interest rates in their Earn program doesn't hurt. 12% on stablecoins is unheard of (with MCO staked) and I can't imagine it will last for much longer. Kris has also mentioned developing DEFI solutions for many of their products that would allow users to retain keys to their crypto which would be a fantastic step forward and could be a turning point if it does come to fruition for many other platforms to follow suit.

The MCO staking requirements for various services, especially the Debit Card maybe a hard pill to swallow for more casual users who aren't as crypto inclined (minor speed bump to adoption - and yes I know the free midnight blue is an option). I think the idea of putting a couple hundred dollars on the line with a largely unknown company like CDC in return for $50 does sound like a great deal unless you were planning on getting a card anyways - it simply doesn't compare to say applying for a checking account/debit card at a globally recognized bank with similar perks...overall a hard-sell for the masses (too early) at this stage unless you're a true crypto fan or just really want free netflix and spotify I don't see regular folks joining in anytime soon. But in due time, if CDC continues its domination, I'm sure their reputation will grow with it.

Kris has mentioned they will be fully profitable by 2020, which is good news as many were curious how they were able to afford many of the perks they provide their users - again, no figures to backup the claim so we'll have to take his word for it. I do hope they become more transparent with their platform performance and figures, but we'll see if they ever do.

The addition of the native currency CRO in addition to the original MCO mucks up the waters a bit for me and has been a divisive topic for many early adopters. I don't personally see why it was necessary to create a new coin as opposed adding new features to MCO's token utility and developing both coins in tandem seems like a monumental task - hopefully the team is up for the challenge.

But all in all a solid product that is bringing the heat to legacy banking (albeit piggybacking on Visa's infrastructure and reach ironically) - I hope to continue seeing improvements with their products in the months to come.

If mass adoption is to become a reality, this is how it happens."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|953477|public|self|Crypto.com: Any thoughts?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/eghn1w/cryptocom_any_thoughts/|all_ads|6|1577464345.0|EXCHANGE|613cabf0-1d90-11e4-953d-12313b0eb482|EXCHANGE|||||||||||2019-12-27 22:02:25+00:00|t3_eghn1w|0|26|0.78||0||[]|False|False|[]|[]|||||||||||||||||||||27_12_19|12_19|0.11076456|0.4499968|0.43923864|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07071885466575623|0.20293867588043213|0.01466779038310051|0.2337827980518341|0.4597536027431488|0.018138350918889046

CambuCoin token allows for open and unrestricted secondary trading. Investors may participate in decision making within community, sustainability or eco projects but also have full flexibility on their CambuCoin portfolio.

CambuCoin token will be fully backed by the assets and real estate of CAMBU Eco Resort. Our goal is to create an ecosystem for real estate in the crypto world for investors to feel comfortable while giving accessibility, liquidity and full transparency for trophy real estate assets.

Globally, the sustainable property market is a fast-developing sector—as supplies are not even close to matching the demand. This is why we’re excited to launch CambuCoin, a digital token, which will help us to create more sustainable rooms, villas and community projects within CAMBU Eco Resort 
 
We are looking for responsible and environmental-friendly investors that are eager to find better ways to invest in the property market today. 

Investing in a digital token that is backed by a sustainable real-estate asset and community-driven projects like CAMBU Eco Resort can revolutionize the whole industry in the long run. It is one way to inspire companies, architects, designers, and builders to deliver more eco-friendly building materials, and also factor in sustainability in the way they do business.

CAMBU Eco Resort is not just another eco resort, it's much more of a concept to involve the local community and help them to develop long-term prosperity and growth.
