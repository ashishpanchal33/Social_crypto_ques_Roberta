My latest contributions were solely focussed around IOTA. I received accommodating and friendly responses from in and outside of the IOTA community which is the reason I keep going as there is obviously demand for these kinds of analysis. Interestingly, after my last two articles around IOTA, I saw people asking for Cardano.

""Cardano is better!""- ""Compare the two!""  - ""ADA 4tw!"" - “They could collaborate!”

And here we are.

One thing is clear, in this space only few big projects spend as much time and effort on research and development as ADA and IOTA do, so the task seems reasonable to me simply because these two candidates are worth it.

**Both projects are representing this space from its best side and both will co-exist. That’s what I believe.**

Disclaimer: I'm not invested in ADA yet, but this may change after the next update, depending on ADA keeping what it promised (Basho + Voltaire era updates).

But more about that in the coming weeks and months.

***Today the topic is: Which chain is better?***

A large part of the normie investors follow this question and try to answer it as soon as possible, because in these times you get headaches not only from Covid19, but also from FOMO.

Sadly, the general approach seems to be opening Crypto Twitter or Youtube and see which project is promoted the most and I'm not sure which project wins this point because both are highly promoted by huge communities but my guess for winning the social score is probably ADA for the time being.

Since few people take the time to compare the two under the surface, I'll give it a shot.

Cardano has inherited a considerable part of the Ethereum community, which is understandable if you’re familiar with the technical and chronological background of Charles Hoskinson.

Charles is an Ethereum co-founder, a veteran and knows what he is doing.

That may be surprising to many that Dominik Schiener, Co-Founder of IOTA is also from this very incubator, who presumably had some connections with Charles and Vitalik at that time. Everyone who followed IOTA lately can say with certainty: Schiener (and the rest of the Foundation) also knows what he’s doing as the [latest efforts](https://blog.iota.org/iotav2devnet/) to decentralize IOTA were quite successful and, under his management, IOTA has navigated through the obstacles of this pioneer-journey without big issues.

Today, both projects can be considered “established” and the initial criticism of IOTA has been leveled out because the last 2 years of development and strategy realignment of the IOTA Foundation have, apparently, paid off so one could argue that IOTA is rehabilitated at once.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here we go.

Some bullet-points that allow the comparison:

**a) Basic stats: genesis, circulating supply, inflation, valuation, fees, transaction speed**

**b) Consensus differences and consequences**

**c) Where lies the focus of applications?**

**d) How high is the social score?**

**e) What are the scaling solutions?**

**f) What about partners and collaborations?**

**g) Who has clear advantages?**

**h) Where should you invest?**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

# a) Basic stats

**IOTA**:  Genesis was in 2015 when the Founders and Co-Founders of the project (that registered the German charitable IOTA Foundation in Berlin later) created a crowd-funding for the IOTA tokens.Roughly $500.000 have been collected without premine. Founders and Developers had to invest like everyone else. Circulating supply is 2,779,530,283 miota: 100% of the total supply.   
IOTA was created non-inflationary without any plans to create more tokens.  
IOTA’s valuation is at $3.4 billion at the time of writing and the ledger doesn’t require fees for sending data or value transactions but tokens are necessary for the latter.  
IOTA was created for the machine to machine economy as part of the internet of things while offering its basic ledger without mining, fees or scaling bottlenecks via a novel consensus mechanism. A coming milestone offers smart contracts.  
With the Chrysalis update, an IOTA transactions takes less than 10 seconds whereas after IOTA 2.0, it takes less than 5 seconds to finalize.

**Cardano**: Genesis was in December 2016 when the Cardano Foundation held an ICO collecting over $60 million within 4 months with roughly 15% premine.

Circulating supply is 31.948.309.441 ADA whereas total supply is at 45.000.000.000 ADA. \~30% of the total supply is yet to hit circulation.  
ADA was created slightly inflationary until staking-rewards and incentives have been paid out but that will take years.  
ADA’s valuation is at roughly $54 billion at the time of writing.  
The ledger was created in order to host smart contracts and to scale better than BTC or ETH without the horrendous energy consumption due to ADA’s proof of stake, while keeping the advantages of secure and decentralized ledgers.  
Fees are calculated per size, plus a constant. Both the constant and the amount per bytes can be modified but in the end it’s \~0.17 ADA which is at \~3 cents right now.  
If the price of one ADA goes up, the fees follow but with the Voltaire update and governance, both values could be changed and reduced to a lower fee depending on stakeholders allowance - which is up for debate as stakers don’t want to lose income. With the Ouroboros consensus and the latest upgrades through Shelley, ADA takes approx. 40 seconds to finalize a transaction.

# b)  Consensus differences and consequences.

*This one is a bit tricky because the architecture and, as a byproduct, the incentives are completely different.*  


**IOTA** created a novel consensus mechanism based on a directed acyclic graph, the Tangle. All Blockchains are DAG’s but not every DAG is a blockchain. IOTA has no blocks and no chain, but it’s still a DAG. The rule (for now) for finding consensus is simple. A user has to do a minuscule (like one [millionth](https://blog.iota.org/internal-energy-benchmarks-for-iota/) of a BTC transaction) amount of proof of work to confirm two older transactions in the network- and in exchange has the permission to send a transaction. For the time being this is accompanied by an onboarding mechanism, a central node that gives direction for all other nodes via milestones: the coordinator.  
This will be replaced by a consensus called FPC (fast probabilistic consensus), additionally a combination of modules that work with a gossip protocol called mana.  
In essence: IOTA remains free, becomes truly decentralized (without the coordinator), will not be mined and is lightweight.  
IOTA is a parallelly confirming ledger which means that many transactions can be done at once. Bitcoin and most if not all other ledgers are sequential. There are other perks to it but the main question I hear a lot is:  
*If there is no mining, what are the incentives to start a full node, why would you pay for that?*  
The answer is simple: Because the industry wants to send data and value without fees.  
The [partner-statistics](https://iotaarchive.com/) on leveraging this ledger despite its missing monetary incentives are quite compelling. The IOTA Foundation believes that a free protocol is the best backbone for a fair and free industrial revolution that benefits everyone on Earth.

**Cardano** with Ouroboros is a proof-of-stake protocol. It distributes network control across stake pools: node operators with the infrastructure required to ensure a consistent and reliable connection to the network. The initial thought was to reduce the energy consumption of Bitcoin and Ethereum and to offer the same dapp landscape Ethereum offers, without drawbacks.

Up to this day, the controversy around proof-of-stake remains:  
*Isn’t it diametrical to the decentralized cause if the biggest stakeholders have the most voting-rights?*

My answer is: It’s the same issue with POW based ledgers, there will always be some kind of centralization but in Cardano we see a degree of excellent execution that makes it impossible to conduct a 51% attack and most other attack vectors.*The slot leaders are chosen from staking pools based on the volume of their stake and a random seed. The seed uses a multi-party computation (MPC) system to determine which stakeholder can be chosen to mint the next blocks*[*¹*](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-cardano#toc-what-is-cardano-s-transaction-speed-tps-)*.*

In easy words: Those that have more coins have a better chance of finding, “minting”, blocks, but they also have the biggest motivation to keep their money which is the incentive.The fees of transactions are then distributed to stakeholders and a small share of 20% to the Treasury, some kind of a Cardano development fund.

The incentive to secure the network is to buy and hold coins, and that way, new investors, “stakers” are found, the network is secure and transaction fees become meaningful. Due to rewards and a higher total than circulating supply, the yearly inflation is calculated (in an ADA Forum) at approx 6.52%.

&amp;#x200B;

# c) Where lies the focus of applications?

**IOTA** is set to become the base layer of the Internet of Things. But that’s far from it.

Data-transactions, data-trading in data-market, digital identities, microtransactions in all industries, verifiable credentials, even store of value is possible according to its non-inflationary nature.  
Due to the new architecture with Chrysalis, that will also be used in IOTA 2.0, the Tangle can be leveraged as a smart contract platform for dapps, DeFi, colored coins and every possible use-case around digital contracts.  
Remember when you had these quartet cards as a kid? The car-card with the highest horse-power wins? IOTA is the fastest car in that regard. There is no application IOTA cannot be used for with IOTA 2.0. Buy a computer or a pizza online, stake DeFi, pay for tickets, enter a building with your unique ID, power a supply chain for immutable audits, use it as a non-inflationary store of value: IOTA can do it. IOTA 2.0 is poised to scale into millions of TPS without fees or mining.

**Cardano** on the other hand is quite focussed on dapps, value transactions and supply chains.  
Though with hydra, the scaling solution of the Cardano Foundation should enable other use-cases around digital identities as it’s supposed to scale into the millions as well, though no practical proof has been delivered so far as it’s years away from implementation.  
IOHK and Cardano Foundation teams work on adoption often in developing countries like all over Africa. Emurgo wrote a fascinating [piece](https://emurgo.io/ja/blog/cardano-strategy-africa) on the “Africa-strategy”. I recommend you read this because the soul of decentralized solutions lies in the participation of those who have less access to the global monetary system, and this ""smart Africa"" Alliance impresses with a pragmatic solution away from the hype.

*Let’s be clear on this one. Both projects have an obvious concern to improve deficits in the world and offer pragmatic solutions.*

*In this field, such an attitude can’t be praised highly enough.*

*The world is big and technological disruption on a broad spectrum like this is rarely done by just one technology so we shouldn’t concentrate on the competitive thought too much.*

&amp;#x200B;

# d) How high is the social score? (Twitter, Reddit, Google, Discord)

&amp;#x200B;

Twitter: **IOTA** has 192.455 follower   
**ADA** has 672.020 follower

Reddit:  **IOTA** has 135.000 subscribers  
**ADA** has 507.000 subscribers  


Google trends:

^((please ignore the blue spike for IOTA as it’s referring to a Hurricane in South America))  


[Google Trends Comparison 12 months](https://preview.redd.it/kdvhn18j81471.png?width=1146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a654e653e9f36b2aa4c1aeb7ce4f884804b2cd0c)

Discord: **IOTA** has 48.000 Member  
**ADA** has 8.200 Member

I believe this is pretty self-explaining. ADA clearly wins the social score.   
I’d like to point out that IOTA has one of the biggest and most active Discord communities I’ve ever met.

&amp;#x200B;

# e) What are the scaling solutions?

&amp;#x200B;

**IOTA** just introduced an already running solution: the IOTA 2.0 DevNet (Nectar) that is using the fast probabilistic algorithm, rate control, mana and essentially a multidimensional layer that theoretically scales into infinity only hindered by external factors like bandwidth and sharding (which is researched right now). [https://v2.iota.org/](https://v2.iota.org/)  
The final deployment on the mainnet has no ETA but is roughly planned at Q4 2021 or Q1 2022.  
IOTA states to have solved the scalability trilemma without fees with that.

**Cardano** plans to change to an extended UTxO model that allows for an efficient state channel solution that operates off-chain, comparable to the lightning network: [Hydra](https://cardanians-io.medium.com/hydra-cardano-scalability-solution-36b05ddc91cf). Though, Hydra is likely to be part of the Cardano 2025 vision and rolled out as part of the Ouroboros Omega update.  
ADA claims to be able to serve mainstream demand with this solution.

&amp;#x200B;

# f) What about partners and collaborations?

&amp;#x200B;

I would have liked to make a list for both projects at the beginning of this analysis, but then, in both cases, the list would have been dozens of pages long, and I don't want to exhaust the attention span.

Fact is, both projects have an enormous number of strategic partners.

This is mainstream adoption material.

The **IOTA** community has produced an excellent website that gives you an idea of how far the efforts have come. [IOTA Archive](https://iotaarchive.com/). We are talking about hundreds of collaborations, partners, patents and proof of concepts. I have rarely seen such a high number in other projects.

With **ADA**, the information is much less concentrated, but still very high and downright impressive.  
[Cardanodevelopment.com](https://www.cardanodevelopment.com/about-us/our-partners/)  
[Publish0x.com](https://www.publish0x.com/wordstock/full-list-of-cardano-ada-partnerships-and-collaborations-202-xpgvdj) (not official)  


Partnerships only mean something if the utility is used to improve problems. No clear winner here. 

&amp;#x200B;

# g) Who has clear advantages?

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, that depends. From my perspective, IOTA is the underdog here, but with huge upside potential both for the social score and price development.  
Cardano has a market cap of already $54 billion, a number IOTA can dream of ($3.1 billion today). Cardano wins the race in terms of network effect, scientific research and reputation and it has a decentralized main-net today.  
IOTA on the other hand has a working scaling solution for tomorrow, that comes without fees, so naturally, I would assume an advantage in the next 2 years because IOTA reached this milestone years before ADA did. Additionally, the spectrum of use-cases is limited for ADA because fees are fees and with a rising price, the fees are poised to go up higher which isn’t really helpful if you compete for the most cost-efficient solution in the realm of data markets, the IOT and digital identities. IOTA clearly has the upper hand here.  


It’s a race of network effect vs earlier reached milestones, though I believe in coexistence and collaboration. Time will tell. 

# h) Where should you invest?

That’s something only you can determine. Hodl, build and diversify.

Disclaimer: I’m neither an IOTA nor a Cardano expert and mistakes happen. This is just a tiny analysis because understanding both projects to its core would take months.   
If my research is off, please leave me a message and I correct the mistake as fast as I see it; if that is the case, provide me with an official source of the claim and I add it, thank you.

What’s important to me is that competition is good, but collaboration is better.  


**Crypto has &lt;in itself&gt; a lot of enemies but we should realize that our way will be better if we work together.**

The last month has been a struggle with a lot of red candles and not much positive price movement. This will cause some stress, especially if you've aped into this with leverage and debt to get into this opportunity. Right now I don't need to point fingers to warn you from not overextending and spending money you can't afford to lose. Experience is the best teacher.

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to say however, is that these kinds of corrections are what happens in a volatile asset class, especially one with a lot of hype around it. Even if the long term trend is fantastic, an asset can be overpriced for the current market conditions. What I'm preaching is perspective. Even after this megadip and slump we find ourselves in, the market is still only back to March/April levels. There's a constant stream of attacks from various governments, you can see a lot of dubious news from the big media outlets. And we're down in the red again. But if we're looking into a longer time perspective, crypto is very clearly outperforming stocks and other asset classes. The security and decentralization provided by blockchains will enable digital markets that we can't even comprehend right now. Smart contracts and decentralized finance is already providing incredible yields, much better than in traditional finance. Without banks, without lawyers and without governments as intermediaries. Everything is peer-to-peer, automated by predictable open source code on the blockchain. The technology is in its infancy and already competing with the incumbents.

&amp;#x200B;

The long term prospects are very good. HODL on, stay calm and enjoy this summer.

 Fear is for the winter, my little lord when the bitcoin crashes a hundred percent deep and the altcoins market caps come down thousands and never recover. Fear is for the long bear market when the green hides its face for years at a time, and many coins are born and live and die all in redness while the whales grow gaunt and hungry, and the scammers lose hope, and  the miners scalp the GPUs.” 

""Four years ago, a bear market dawned on us that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man. There came a night that crashed bitcoin 90 %, and whales shivered and lost their billions, even as the Doge holders with their pennies. Day traders sold their holdings at losses rather than see them go to zero, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks. 

""In that darkness, the mainstream media and wall street fud came for the first time. ""They are cold things, dead things, that hated blockchain and decentralization, and every creature with hot blood in its veins. They only loved money and controlling the common man.  13 years ago, they crashed the world’s economy and swept over countries and kingdoms, destroyed banks and companies by the score, driving their yachts and playing golf, laughing while leading hosts of the slain.  

All the protests of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them. They hunted the maids throughout the world, and evicted people out of their homes, and expelled millions out of their job, it was in that year the world’s economy collapsed.  

So as hunger and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the blockchain, in the hopes that decentralized power could win back what the common people lost. He set out into the deadlands of programing with a mug, a headphone, a dog, and a dozen companions. For years he searched until he despaired of ever finding the solution to bankers and wall street greed in their secret corners of the internet. In that darkness Satoshi Nakamoto made bitcoin.

One of the things I noticed was the amount of holdings of each coin. He had something like 2800 LINK. When the time came for me to make some purchases, I very quickly realized that he was managing a very large amount of money.

How was this possible? Here's me purchasing 30 of them, and he has almost 100x as many as me. My portfolio was a tiny fraction of his. I felt awful and that I was basically wasting my time. That feeling has since passed, of course, but it kind of came full swing yesterday.

Someone had made a comment in the daily about how proud they were to have purchased one single LINK. One!

Invest whenever you can, even if it’s only a couple of dollars every few months… it all adds up over time. This isn’t a get rich quick scheme at all. Those who choose to stay in the ring and to fight with all their willpower will come out of it champions.

***Find the full blog post with all the tables is*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-41)***.***

Welcome everyone, especially the newcomers, do your monthly no-shill data dump: the Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment Updates are here at last!

But first: A 20% bonus for doing nothing with Moons?  Nah! Freely you have received moons, freely give moons away: **68** ***Moons to the first person to name the artist and title of the song hidden in this post AND saying something kind about another Redditor. That's worth about $5 (68\*.073) at the moment, my way of encouraging the winner to support*** r/CryptoCurrency ***with a*** ***special membership!***

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for over three often very painful years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, and 2021. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **May** \- **ADA** only crypto in the green, the rest have a very (along with all of crypto) have a very rough month 
* **Overall since Jan. 2018** \- 40% of cryptos in the green, **ETH** flips **BTC** for the lead, +26%
* **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 349%.**

## Month Forty-One – UP 26%

[The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio - ADA saves May from a red wall of death](https://preview.redd.it/b5ud9po6h1471.jpg?width=822&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97c1d59b37800cbe9d4ed1b97305471e92e7150b)

A tough month for crypto and a tough month for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio.  Although **ADA** saved the group from a dreaded all-red month, the 2018 Top Ten had its second worst month [since the Experiment began](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) – only [March 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-three/) saw a larger decline in value.    

More bad news: after finally breaking even in [April](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-40), **Litecoin** has slipped back into negative territory.  There  are now only four cryptos (**BTC, ETH, ADA, XLM**) in the green.

Silver lining? The 2018 Top Ten Cryptos are still up 26% since January 2018.  This is roughly where the portfolio was in March.  Check out how that return compares to the S&amp;P and the other Experiments below.   

## May Movement Report, Ranking, and Dropouts

Predictably, there were many more cryptos moving down than up this month:

Downs:

* **NEM** – after falling 11 places last month, NEM fell down nine more places (#49–&gt;#58), has now dropped out of the Top 50, and is now dangerously close to finding itself outside the *Top Sixty.*  
* **IOTA** – down eight places (#29–&gt;#37)
* **Dash** – down five places (#46–&gt;#51), also out of the Top [Fiddy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qm8PH4xAss)
* **Litecoin** – down three places (#11–&gt;#14)
* **XRP** – down three places (#4–&gt;#7)
* **Bitcoin Cash** – down three places and out of the Top Ten (#10–&gt;#13)

Up:

* **ADA** – up three places (#7–&gt;#4)

[ 2018 Top Ten Rank - a lot can change in 3.5 years](https://preview.redd.it/7i7ssmpbh1471.jpg?width=273&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b21bfd0e0bab7cc6f02c827f9303b3278164e735)

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** After forty-one months of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, 60% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Tether**, **DOT, UNI**, **Doge**, and most recently, **USDC.**  That’s two stablecoins in the Top Ten for those keeping count.

## May Winners and Losers

***May Winner*** –  Winner, singular: despite a bloody month in crypto, **ADA** had a very strong May, finishing the month up +33%.  

***May Losers*** –  Aw, **NEM**: for the third month in a row, **NEM** (-44.4%) was the worst performing of the 2018 Top Ten cryptos. **IOTA** didn’t do much better, down -43.9%.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After forty-one months, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. 

[2018 Ws and Ls](https://preview.redd.it/39pd9zjfh1471.jpg?width=273&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea578d6be701961fa6c8621475e2921fcd86ec2d)

With 10, **Bitcoin** has the most monthly wins. With May’s loss, **NEM** has now finished in last place 11 of 41 months, or 27% of the time.

**Bitcoin** is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018, although it has come very close a couple of times.

## Overall Update –  Portfolio back at March levels, 40% of cryptos in positive territory, ETH flips BTC for lead

Although it lost 30% of its total value this month, May marks the fourth straight month the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio is in positive territory.  The past four months ***has been the only time the portfolio has been in the green.***  That’s thirty-seven straight months in the red, followed by the last four months of green.

40% of the 2018 Top Ten are in positive territory: **BTC,** **ETH, ADA**, and **XLM**.  **ETH** (+265%) has overtaken **Bitcoin** (+179%) as the best performing crypto of the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio.  Coming up fast behind **BTC** is **ADA**, up +163% after a strong May.

The initial $100 invested in **ETH** forty-one months ago is worth $366 today.

Still at the bottom is **Dash,** down -81% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  The initial $100 invested forty-one months ago is worth $19 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/9uc4rxgjh1471.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6ff9e36ddf44e10ee8dad36cab39b76068207f4

After closing [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-40) over $2T,  the total crypto market cap dipped back down to $1.64T, the same level it was at a few months ago.  As a sector, crypto is up +185% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  If you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much better than both the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+26%) and the S&amp;P (+57%) over the same time period. 

## Bitcoin dominance:

Another significant drop in **BitDom** this month.  Not quite as dramatic as [April](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-40) (which saw the steepest monthly decline since the Experiment began), but one of the largest monthly declines in **Bitcoin** Domination in the last 3.5 years.  For context, we still have a bit to go before setting a record **BitDom** low: the last altcoin cycle saw **BTC** dominance go down to a low of 33% back in the first month of the [2018 Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

[ 2018 Top Ten ROI ](https://preview.redd.it/tq6pzv2nh1471.jpg?width=406&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2ff01a5dc6924877b42623e070b528926f3fe73)

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost about $292 in May, breaking a seven month streak of upward movement that started in [September 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33/).  

Despite the down month, the 2018 group has been in the green for four straight months. If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would return $1,264**, up +56% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month:

[ 2018 Top Ten Monthly ROI](https://preview.redd.it/4mhztb9ph1471.jpg?width=604&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ef44bf4a5f99e1abf1843cf8ab1bb1fcf30b39b)

It’s been a rocky road, to say the least.  The absolute bottom was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/) followed closely by the -87% Zombie Apocalypse month ([March 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27/)) just over a year ago. 

A public service announcement: it’s harder to see in the middle of a bull market, but the month of May and the numbers above should be a cautionary tale.  Before jumping into crypto, take a moment to think how you would react if you were down -88% on your investment after one year and -87% after two years.  That age old advice of not investing what you can’t afford to lose?  Probably pretty good advice.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

That’s a wrap for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the ***2019***, ***2020,*** and ***2021*** Top Ten Cryptos as well.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?  

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-41): up +26% (total value $1,264)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-29): up +459% (total value $5,594)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +630% (total value $7,300)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5): up +281% (total value $3,809)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$17,967** ($1,264 + $5,594 + $7,300 + $3,809).

**That’s up +349%** on the combined portfolio.  While this is a massive drop from last month, the combined portfolios are back to where they were two months ago in [March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39/). For some perspective, here’s the a look at the monthly ROI of the combined portfolios:

[ Combined ROI of all four Top Ten Crypto Portfolios - back to March levels](https://preview.redd.it/f9kmqtfsh1471.jpg?width=568&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67ac91004a5de9d7e6bc6c789a868a1fe321887e)

***That’s a +349% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for four straight years***. 

## Top Ten Approach vs. All-In Approach

An index fund is designed to mitigate risks, so going all-in on one coin would have produced better returns, right?  

Short answer: yes.  If you guess correctly.  Let’s take a look.

Only five cryptos have begun each of the last four years in the Top Ten: **BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,** and **LTC**. 

Assuming the same $1k on January 1st four years in a row strategy of the Experiment, which crypto would prevail?

[ Four year club - shoulda went ETH ](https://preview.redd.it/d6gospsvh1471.jpg?width=653&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5661f4a25bab186ee1502bc64f9c46e925016ff1)

**Ethereum** by far. **$4,000 into Ethereum** in $1k chunks once a year **would now be worth $47,562**. That’s up **+1089%**.

In distant second place, going all in on **Bitcoin** with $4,000 USD would have yielded **+377%**, turning the initial $4k investment into **$19,089.**  

A close third place?  The [Top Ten Portfolio approach](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/), up **+349%**.  Not bad!  And getting closer to an all-in on **Bitcoin.**  This is about what you’d expect for an Index strategy, falling somewhere between the best and worst performers.

At the bottom?  Even though **BCH** would have been your worst four year all-in bet, this super-slow dollar cost averaging approach would still be returning **+144%**, still much better than the S&amp;P (see below).

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  Nothing too dramatic, but the S&amp;P continued to tick up in May, setting yet another all time high.

[ Another month, another ATH for the S&amp;P ](https://preview.redd.it/2v713ca4i1471.jpg?width=505&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ada037c720d502b4c4750008dfc93ae6046ceed)

The S&amp;P 500 is up +57% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1570 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.  

As I mentioned [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-40), I was hoping May would finally be the month the 2018 Top Ten outperformed the overall S&amp;P returns over the same period of time.  Alas, it was not meant to be so my champagne stays on ice.

But it’s still not a very fair fight when I combine the four portfolios: taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments yields the following:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1570 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1680 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1300 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1120 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,670** ($1,570 + $1,680 + $1,300 + $1,120)

That is up **+42%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+349%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 307% ***in favor of crypto.***

You can compare against five individual coins (**BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,** and **LTC)** by using the table above if you want.  The key takeaway? Using a similar investing strategy, the S&amp;P 500 is currently severely underperforming **XRP**, **Bitcoin Cash, BTC, ETH, LTC** and **the Top Ten Crypto Portfolio approach**.

Here’s a table summarizing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments.

Despite the big crypto dip this month, crypto is still far, far ahead of the S&amp;P over the same time period.

## Conclusion:

May was undoubtedly a tough month for crypto, but not apocalyptic: more of a shoulder shrug when you zoom out and take a look at the big picture.

My hope to be able to report this month that a 2018 homemade index fund of cryptos created as an Experiment by some guy on the internet surpassed the gains of the mighty S&amp;P 500 was dashed.  If May was a blip in the bull market, maybe I’ll be able to announce this in the coming months.  If we’re at or near the top, that dream will have to hibernate for a while. 

Which is it?  Are we at the top or only hitting some mid bull cycle bumps?  Your guess is as good as mine.  So far, the Experiments show that taking a long term approach seems to be paying off, at least for now.  

To the long-time Experiment followers: thanks so much for reading and for supporting the project over the years.  

For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow help you see what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and enjoy the ride!

Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for monthly progress reports.

Just wanted to share my own experience. My phone wound up at the bottom of a lake on Saturday. This is the first time I’ve had to use my seeds for recovering a wallet. Aside from going through the steps needed to access where I had stored them (which in hindsight is nothing compared to burning all my crypto), it was such a simple and seamless process. 

No need to call a bank, no need to sit on hold with customer service, no need to wait for a new debit/credit card, etc.

Owning crypto is the first time it’s ever felt like I actually (truly) had any money at all, as opposed to just numbers on a screen, a value pacing far behind inflation. 

I personally underestimated the security, securing your own funds, etc. until being faced with this process.

Hey there, I am fairly new to the crypto-world and wanted to know what some risks would be if I took out a fairly decent size personal loan ($15,000) and staked it in a stable coin such as USDC on an exchange that offers a high APR% for staking that coin?  My thinking is that if i can secure a personal loan with a low interest monthly payment, I would stake the loan amount ($15,000) into a USDC, and then pay the first couple monthly interest payments out of pocket. By then, my initial investment of (15,000) would have enough time to compound interest that by the 4th repayment of the interest on the loan comes around I would skim money from my initial investment via the compounding interest to essentially pay the loan off with ""Free"" money and i would keep the rest to restake into USDC.

""Inflation is closely watched by cryptocurrency investors who view Bitcoin as a hedge against dollar debasement. 

But bitcoin has also traded at times in sync with risky traditional assets like stocks, and the Deutsche Bank authors warned that when inflation does eventually appear, the Fed might have to react forcefully, which could 'create a significant recession and set off a chain of financial distress around the world.'

Adding to the pressures are some $2 trillion of “excess savings” that consumers have amassed over the past year, when many businesses were closed and travel mostly shut down, according to the report published Monday.

“Consumers will surely spend at least some of their savings as economies reopen,” wrote Deutsche Bank Chief Economist David Folkerts-Landau along with Peter Hooper, global head of economic research, and Jim Reid, head of thematic research.. “This raises the very real specter of consumer-driven inflation.”"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3053431|public|self|Inflation could send the global economy into recession as central banks lose control|0|[]|0.87|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/numka9/inflation_could_send_the_global_economy_into/|all_ads|6|1623077593.0||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'kVObDCmY9XKkRrOjzSLLmAvDjiNlDC6yt6S3PvAyda4', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t6SZiZh94VDnGBmt1XXZz9FOA35EBvZGeRRu_5mPm5k.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a838381452242c33015825a41a9be0c255803180', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t6SZiZh94VDnGBmt1XXZz9FOA35EBvZGeRRu_5mPm5k.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbc7814f7d78cee22118491fb6f87ad0cfc2b59f', 'width': 216}, {'height': 167, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t6SZiZh94VDnGBmt1XXZz9FOA35EBvZGeRRu_5mPm5k.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe409524f7e1c30c7351cdca49a4b13d0616471d', 'width': 320}, {'height': 334, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t6SZiZh94VDnGBmt1XXZz9FOA35EBvZGeRRu_5mPm5k.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ca447c21f96b794765c046b6c705a95d38c7ff5', 'width': 640}, {'height': 502, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t6SZiZh94VDnGBmt1XXZz9FOA35EBvZGeRRu_5mPm5k.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89f7d7a42c2599ff430eb024b767ff08b59e0d7c', 'width': 960}, {'height': 565, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t6SZiZh94VDnGBmt1XXZz9FOA35EBvZGeRRu_5mPm5k.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f178059b4a0725697abe3f75d7ade565fb5c485', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 628, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/t6SZiZh94VDnGBmt1XXZz9FOA35EBvZGeRRu_5mPm5k.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=44982818d5edbd7d7505c856da0fde0a6891c9b7', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||2021-06-07 20:23:13+00:00|t3_numka9|0|12||

You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I'm aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for Moons where I don't have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a 'breakfast platter' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you're happy!

I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that.  I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.

Most of us are told, rightfully, to guard this private key with our lives, because anyone who gets access to it will be able to take your hard earned cash away. But what if someone like the FBI guessed your private key?
This is how private keys look like for Bitcoin wallets:

KzvYyd4vZ94NyRdgAHFmgtVEFaGi7drgu94DjhCYEf51UqReb1Dp
L5HRstY66Urp2VfwvqqASVwHQNJRUJuHg5p6BB46JxJfwccZ5cZV
L4Wn4W1hDzzV6a1D9HYnwSBf1m1vzHMWJ6Y8gHT4igDnkwU2GcWK

All three of those wallet addresses are 52 characters each encompassing both the English alphabet and digits 0 to 9. Bitcoin(and all other cryptos) rely on the fact that each private key is completely new, never seen before and never to be seen again by anyone else. Bitcoin doesn’t check for collisions when you generate a new wallet address. But this raises the question, with the ever increasing number of users that are adopting crypto and the fact that one person can have many wallets and even the fact that there are groups such as the FBI dedicated to finding private keys of wallets, what are the chances that your private key could either be guessed or collide with a newly generated wallet with the same address?

In fact as crypto adoption grows and potentially replaces fiat currency entirely, there will be a number of people who'd definitely think about the prospect of becoming a digital treasure hunter. Just trying address after address until they got to an account with potentially thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of Bitcoin/ETH/etc.

What if these people were to create a database of all the possible Bitcoin addresses and then just start to pull out money from all of them one by one? To explain why this wouldn't be possible, all of the world's computers combined today would provide about 2.3 zetabytes of storage according to some estimates. 1 yottabyte = 1000 zettabytes. To store all Bitcoin addresses you would require 5 yottabytes^2 storage space. There isn't enough coal and gas on Earth to make the electricity that would store this database.

Put another way, there are more Bitcoin addresses than atoms in the known universe.
How is this possible? Here's an example of a private key which is 64 characters in the range of 0 - 9 and A - F: E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262, this private key doesn't exist for any crypto by the way I got it from an answer on Quora, there are 64 characters, and each character is hexadecimal meaning it can hold 16 different case insensitive values(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F), meaning there are 16^64 possible private key combinations. Now assume that the world population is 7.6 billion and everyone holds a wallet which adds up to 7.6 billion private keys, even in an imaginary best case the success rate of finding a correct private key is 100 multiplied by 7.6 billion divided by 16^64 which is 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000065634881018717779152936274157283036740481602769715738%.

In short I just wanted to show everyone how cool the Math behind cryptocurrency is and how while it may seem easy to imagine guessing a private key, it's a gargantuan task that not even the most powerful computers working together in the world today could think of pulling off and how unlikely it is to ever be possible.

I have a question. 

Where do you guys research upcoming coins/projects to find out about the company behind and everything about it? 

I usually buy and hodl, but i do have a small budget that i gamble a bit with for fun and i do like to research and read about the different coins and the companies that release them. 

After todays blow up with ATA almost as soon as it released, i realised that the coins i usually research are coins that is already on the market and arent moving to much (in this case, its for the small fun budget but also to see if some upcoming projects are something i believe in and want to hodl)

My parents have lived through a civil war, jumping over dead bodies to go visit family or friends. The country has been through so much since its inception. Losing the native currency was also disheartening to see when the USD was adopted. Crime has been relatively rampant but the new president has done much to curb this. I sincerely hope crypto can bring a bright future to my small country. Both surfing and crypto seem to be bringing lots of international people over and making headlines. I used to have to show people on a map where El Salvador is and what language I speak.

Those who sold their crypto for USD would be left with worthless fiat and the riches would be in control of the majority of both currencies.

We keep comparing ourselves to other people and keep feeling like you wish you had more money to ""invest"" into crypto.

What you should really be doing instead is:

1. Try see how much you can learn daily instead and base your measurement of success on how much you have learned and are busy learning.
2. Keep track of what you did in the past, what you did wrong, what you are doing differently. Basically assess whether you are just dicking around or actually investing. Are you moving forward or moving backward.
3. Study new technologies, new coins, new attack vectors for example try understand how flash loan attacks works and how they could affect you. (Basically stay recent).
4. Make connections, find new people to learn things from and share ideas with.
5. Have actual goals, figure out if you are reaching them, set new goals. Basically have a plan

&amp;#x200B;

The TLDR is:

If you are busy daily learning something new and enriching your mind with ways to achieve your goals or just learning things to improve your life, then you are moving forward. So stop refreshing your apps and checking coinmarketcap and be happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also you can't put a price on learning, but let's say you wanted to it would be well worth it. I'm busy doing a solidity course with a friend. He paid for an online course to learn solidity, he played around with his new found skill, took some kind of shitcoin factory, modified it a bit to make it work more efficiently and get the gas fees down, then launched it on a few different chains (BSC, Polygon etc), he's already made 4 x his money back that he spent on the Solidity course.

&amp;#x200B;

For example most people I know who have a bit in crypto they are HODLing, are trying to pay off a bit of debt. If you learning something useful which is helping you get closer to that goal then you should be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried for years to learn to trade shares, but didn't really get it, didn't get what it was about, didn't get how it could help me on the long run. From dabbling in crypto, I've now understood long term trading better, got me into reading more, so I started reading books about share trading and also got me to learn that your trading psychology is important. In the past not just did I waste money trying to learn to trade shares, I also wasted money. Learning always costs something, but the ROI on learning is usually incredibly high.

The more you or focussed on something else  than constantly checking coinmarketcap, the easier it becomes to HODL, longterm.

I see so many of these coins just, swing in value. I still don't understand the value in most, and they all seem to be claiming that they'll be the ""revolutionary"" change, the new ETH, the new capital decider, etc. etc.

So many of these claims sound like a marketing team adding in buzzwords. Certain smaller coins I know of such as ONE, RVN, VET, DASH, KNC. Shitcoins like pancake, farm, etc. 

These projects claim they'll do so much, that they'll add so much or make things better, but, all I see is ""trade this and that, buy this so I make tons of money"". So many projects spam them out without providing anything, but what's to say those claims of providing something, are actually benefitting?

I'm uneasy about them all, and would love information or sources to read on why I'm wrong. I see the claims of ""This is revolutionary"" but, **why?** Everything can't always be revolutionary. How long does it need to be?

Thank you for any input, links, and your time in reading. &lt;3

And we were able to create and deliver the best version of what I imagined Coinseed to be. So it is with an incredibly heavy heart that today I’m announcing that we are winding down the business due to a lawsuit from NYAG.
 
Coinseed was a great idea and it has proven that micro-investing is the best way to invest in highly volatile markets such as cryptocurrencies. I’m proud of what I built and proved, but at the same time it’s incredibly sad and frustrating to shut down the business I built for 4 years.
 
So what happened?
In 2017, we conducted an ICO and raised a good amount of money from non-US investors (mostly European) to support Coinseed’s future development. We’ve successfully developed Coinseed and made it the largest micro-investing app in crypto. Coinseed continued to grow even during the “crypto winter” of 2018 and 2019. We’ve expanded our development team and the crypto market has finally taken off in a monster way. We were living the American dream. And then we’ve realized we made a fatal mistake by simply living in New York. It may sound strange, but it’s exactly what happened.
 
Our ICO excluded US investors and we’ve paid back more than twice the ICO amount to the ICO investors as rewards so far. And there hasn’t been any (not even a single one) complaints about our ICO or our token from the investors. Regardless of that, NYAG office has decided to set a precedent of using the infamous Martin Act on crypto companies using Coinseed. The Martin Act is an outrageous state law which gives New York Attorney General almost unlimited power to subpoena and investigate companies in NY even if there were no complaints against them. And an even crazier thing is that we can’t even disclose the subpoena. It had to be secret. See, everything should’ve been fine if we weren’t NY-based. 
 
Just after our ICO, they subpoenaed us over the ICO and they have been constantly harassing us for the last 3 years. We couldn’t even list our token in other exchanges because of their constant pressure and bullying and had to scrap many app features just to please them. Coinseed is a small startup with little money and we couldn’t hire good lawyers to fight them in the court which would cost millions of dollars. We’re not Ripple. And there is still no clear legal frameworks for crypto markets and there was zero in 2017. We have complied with their every request, provided every single documents they asked and we even had discussions with them to what should we do to make our app more compliant the current laws. They just kept assuring us that everything was fine and they would finish the investigation very soon. Why would they wait for 3 years?
 
The sexual abuser Eric Schneiderman started it when he was AG and the current NYAG Letita James continued it for 3 years without finding any wrong doings.  Then last September, they offered a settlement asking us to pay them a few hundred thousand dollars to close the ”investigation”. We were sick of the so called investigation and answered them that we would accept the deal and transfer our company from New York to another crypto-friendly state. But the following day, they changed their mind and wanted to shut down our company. I didn’t want to accept the deal, but my co-founder wanted to accept it and go away. I’m the only board member of Coinseed and I’ve had complete control of the company from day one. It was the fruit of my many sleepless nights and hard work. So I had to let go my co-founder and other team members the next day and left alone. And I’ve been running my company all by myself since last September, just like when I started it in 2017. 
 
NYAG has also accussed us of being an unregistered broker-dealer. It’s very laughable since there is no other cryptocurrency exchange has become a registered broker-dealer. According to the NYAG, Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini are all unregistered broker-dealers since they don’t have the broker-dealer licenses. Just check it. The only difference is that they have enough money to fight in the court and NYAG know that their own arguments are just bullshits and have no chance to beat them in the court. But they know that they can bully us, because we can’t spend millions of dollars in legal fights. There is still no regulations about how to classify cryptocurrencies and what kind of licenses they should obtain to run a business in the US. We don’t even have a clear guidance on how to pay crypto-related taxes. This will just create more victims and also provide more opportunities to crooks like Letita James and Erik Schneiderman.
 
As for the user funds, it will be returned soon and we’re hiring a law firm for the matter. They will reach out to you soon. However, please annoy the NYAG as much as you can since they are the people who caused all the mess. Call them, email them, write letters to them, curse them. The more, the better. We haven't had any payment providers since February because our payment provider has discontinued the relationship due to the lawsuit and we have no option to send or receive payments since then.
 
As for the NYAG Letita James and her cronies, I've created a dedicated token FLJ (Fuck Letita James). Check it out. It’ll be listed on various DeFi platforms soon and will be available for trading. You can also join the airdrop event and receive your free FLJ (Fuck Letita James) tokens.

The idea of an MMO that allows in in-game digital assets to be the property of the player rather than the developer, thus allowing assets to be freely traded with fiat or any other means, is very exciting. However, there will always be bad actors in any economy. Every popular existing MMORPG has a black market for in-game currency, and bad actors most efficiently extract this value by using bot scripts to preform tasks in MMOs that generate in-game currency that can then be sold for real currency. This artificial creation of in-game assets dirastically devalues legitimate assets of real players. The developers of these MMOs tend to be in a constant struggle with these bot farms. The primary means they have to fight them is to detect and remove offending accounts that use automated software, along with any in-game wealth stored inside them. How will decentralized gaming be able to defend against automated software so that legitimate players are able to thrive and compete in their economies if these bad actors can retain their in-game assets? Will every blockchain MMORPG still have to effectivly stay centralized in order to be able to police their economies to prevent scripts from generating all the in-game wealth?|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3053187|public|self|How will blockchain MMOs defend against bots?|0|[]|0.74|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nulo53/how_will_blockchain_mmos_defend_against_bots/|all_ads|6|1623075398.0||||||||||||||2021-06-07 19:46:38+00:00|t3_nulo53|0|5||

If you, like me, heat your home in the winter using only resistance heaters, you can actually run your computers as coin miners without increasing your electric bill.

Most (general purpose) computers have a power supply in the 10-100s of watts range, while resistance heaters operate at about 1500 W, with a 5-20% duty cycle. Since most homes use more than one heater, all but the beefiest computers won’t even produce enough heat to offset full output of the heaters. Accordingly, if you run the miner all the time, you won’t overheat your house, but will instead be causing the resistance heaters to run less frequently. This won’t add a single cent to your normal heating bill.

Note that this doesn’t apply if you use gas heaters or heat pumps. These systems can add heat at a far lower cost per watt than resistance heaters."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3052773|public|self|LPT: Use electric heaters?
