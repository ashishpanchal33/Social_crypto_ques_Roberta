Seriously?

It's so freeing. Cryptocurrency helps me wake up each day even. I don't really look at the charts as much as when I first got into Crypto, but it gives me hope. I realize that the world is headed towards decentralized finance. From my perspective it's inevitable.

Investing now, you are going to be so ahead of the world in 10 years. Mark my words, in a decade we're gonna see CBDCs everywhere, Bitcoin will have hit a million or more and we'll all be laughing how we saw it coming.

The reality is, this revolution started before DeFi or Bitcoin. Back when the U.S. dollar was divorced from gold, it lost its value. 

Cryptocurrency is more than a way to secure financial freedom. It's an answer to a huge problem of money meaning absolutely nothing besides being controlled by institutions and greedy motherf*ckers.

Anyway, off my high horse. I love Crypto. I am excited for what's to come, even though there is going to be lots of regulation and FUD on the way there.

In particular I am going to look into Ethereum since it has the most direct comparison between PoW and PoS (for what I hope are obvious reasons)

Throughout this post I have many assumptions, but in general, I give PoW the best case assumption and PoS the worst case. You will see why towards the end.

Let's say you want to attack the Ethereum PoW chain. Let's say you buy one the brand new, state of the art antminer e9. They should run about $50,000 at most since they have a hash rate equivalent to 32 rtx 3080s which would cost you about $30,000 (plus a couple PSUs and 3-4 mining Motherboards). The E9 clocks in around 3GH/s

Note that buying other equipment like GPUs would likely be cheaper because for the antminer you are paying for the power efficiency, but we don't really care about that here since double spends only take short bursts of work to perform.

https://wattummanagement.com/bitmain-antminer-e9-asic/

Ethereum is currently at 715 TH/s, so starting from scratch you would need 715,000GH /3GH = 283,333 miners for a total cost of about $12b (and that would double ethereum's hash rate). If you bought any of the miners from existing miners or just reneged them, the cost would be much lower.

At that point, you could attack the network freely. I can get 1kw for $0.1, so someone with billions at their disposal should be able to get much better, but let's run with $0.1. let's say we want to do a double spend. So we send some Ethereum and 2 minutes later re-org and include a different transaction so it no longer happens. That should take only a few minutes worth of mining to achieve, but goes faster if you have more than 50%. Let's say doing so takes you 15 minutes.

That would consume 2556 watts /hour x .25 hour x 283,333 / 1000 w/kw * $.1/kwh = $18,105.

Basically nothing to actually attack the network. Even if we multiply this by 10, it is easily covered by the rounding on the $12B above.

So all in it would cost you $12b to attack the current PoW chain (maximum). And you should be able to do it for cheaper. And you can do it as many times as you want. If someone blocks your IP,  you can use another or a VPN. There is no way to identify if your miners are good or bad.

Now let's do PoS.

Let's say, in the BEST case scenario. You buy eth from people already staked. And you buying eth doesn't make the price move at all (unlikely). There is currently 7.9M eth staked, so getting to 50% would cost you 7.9M x 50% x $3550 = $14b

The hardware required to do so is negligible, so now let's attack the network. You try a double spend just like before and wait, what's that? The network didnt come to a consensus on finality? The minority chain saw you double spend and slashed all validators that agreed. You lost about $7b in the blink of an eye. The network has some issues for about 2 weeks until it comes back online good as new and your pockets about $7b lighter.

In order to have the possibility of successfully attacking you need a super majority of 66.7% to get past finality. So now let's buy 66.7%. now we are looking at a cost of $18.7B. keep in mind this is Ethereum bought assuming no price action at all and bought from validators currently in the network. (If you bought and wanted to get up to 66.7% from scratch outside the validator pool, you would be at $42b -still assuming price wouldn't increase from your buys)

With 66.7% of the network, you can get to finality. So you can spend, then double spend to your heart's content. Your first one is likely successful. Probably your next few as well if you did them soon enough. But the other validators can see this. Its a huge story and the entire crypto space knows it within about a day or two. Since your eth is tied into specific validators the existing good validators can easily just break off and ignore your validators. Slashing them for the double spend and then counting them as offline. It's trivial to do and doesn't require a code change of Ethereum itself (but would require a client update just ignoring specific validators from the consensus). So now you are essentially running a forked version of Ethereum. Everyone knows your chain isnt right, it had a double spend. So you lose half your eth again, but it's worse this time. Your validators actions are ignored by the network, so you can even withdraw half your eth like you potentially could have under a 51% attack. You lose everything.

TLDR / Summary

The cost to attack PoW would be $12b in the worst case scenario, but would likely cost much less than that (assuming you could buy existing hardware rather than brand new. Buying current operations has the effect of lowering the ""good"" network hashrate).

To attack PoS, at best it would cost you $18B, but likely it would cost you at least double to triple that since buying billions of eth would drive the price up and make it far more expensive for you to attack. Plus people staking aren't exactly selling their eth by in large, so you'd run into issues there.

PoS costs WAY more to attack than PoW and the cost will likely only go up as more validators join and the merge goes live

(Side note Bitcoin is currently at 148EH/s. An antminer s19 pro costs $10-12k and runs 110TH/s would cost you 148000000 / 110 x $12,000 = $16.15b to get to 50% hash rate from scratch)"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3570064|public|self|PoW vs PoS cost of a double spend.

I prefer 2017 for its sim but 2013 for graphs. Just copy them into your google drive to edit.

**So one way people take profit is to DCA out as the market gets hot. But there are details, like when exactly do I wanna sell?**

There are many ways to do it, but the two ways I chose to look at were the [Rainbow Chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/) and 190 day SMA [envelope](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/envelope/?solution=43000502260). Trading view has indicators similar to the rainbow chart: [Bitcoin Logarithmic Curves](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/search/bitcoin%20logarithmic/). Some with bands that get closer to account for diminished returns.

Neither of these things are predictive. They're long term trend lines with bands set at percentages. And the higher the price gets from the trend line, the more likely it will crash.

Also, as market cap goes up volatility goes down so the highest peaks become increasingly difficult to reach.

**Google Sheet:**

What this google sheet does is to go through candlesticks from previous cycles to see how the strategy would have fared back then to hopefully give you insights. eg. sells when price is 100% above the rainbow chart's middle band.

The readme page shows things like, what percentage each band of the rainbow chart is set at. And similar things.

It's also worth thinking, how long did bitcoin spend in the highest bands? Is it enough time for me? **What margin of error do I want?**

Stuff to adjust include size of profit taking, amount of BTC to keep, and what level to start taking profit. And reinvest stuff.

**So what about alts?**

Common take profit methods I've heard of:

* When price 2x, 3x etc
* Based on alts' performance
* At round number points, eg $6k ETH
* Sell based on status of bitcoin (eg. rainbow chart, since the market mostly follows bitcoin)

I'll be making a post on alts in a day or two so stay tuned. I'm also posting small updates on r/leafypineglass so I don't spam main. It will be based on rainbow chart and envelope also.

Bitcoin noted close to 15% gains while some ALTS rally hard with crazy gains as much as + 50%, just to name a few: Harmony One, Fantom, Celer, etc.

The Top alts actually suffered some lost within +- 10% (ADA, Solana, BNB) but still at bay trying to keep pace with BTC. 

Now DOT! Polkadot, the 8th ranked alt, however, seemed to have gained some decent momentum. As DOT noted 6.5% daily and 13% weekly gains, trading around $35 during these times, once again speculations about the alt reaching its ATH rose. 

This time, as Polkadot comfortably sat above the crucial $33 resistance, the real question was whether these gains were market-driven. If not, then, can they sustain?

Amid high anticipation from DOT’s price and heightened hope that the network could announce the Polkadot parachain auctions in the coming weeks, DOT’s social volumes saw major spikes with Polkadot being a ‘project in trends’ on social media.

But the entry to participate in these launches is very high especially to third world people whose native currency is valued lot less compared to USD.

Me, being from India, 1000$ for investing in a token launch is a big amount of money unaffordable by 80% of citizens. But to get into these, I would need to have native tokens of these launchpads which eats up a lot of that amount. For e.g. Polkastarter need minimum 250 POLS which cost around 2$ and that sets me back by half the amount already. Even then it is just a lottery system which means the 500$ I put in is still a wild gamble coz the allocation is not guaranteed as well as the price might anytime plummet. Similar approach goes for other modes of public sale that is over allocation. For e.g. people who stake 15K USD worth tokens like BNB/ETH with get some 1K or 500USD worth allocations of the tokens (might get much less too).. which means I need to either have 15K worth assets or loan 15K worth of those assets (for which I need to deposit much higher value collateral) which is crazy lot money.

Whatever the method may be it only benefits the rich people who could easily afford these things. In other words these are the rich get more rich schemes.. Blockchain being decentralization focused, I don't see any fair value here.. So my questions are,

1. What are the other ways these launches are happening (apart from fair launches) in which retail and average pocket investors can get in?

However, self-governed of the amount being transferred, global scale blockchain-based cryptocurrencies suffer from high transaction waiting times and gas fees. These impediments prevent the global real use of cryptocurrencies by masses instead of the traditional mainstream payment processors such as Visa.   To address these challenges, Xpal Proof of Credit Channel Network is planning as the most workable solution to be used for micro-payments (for first step for int’l trade shows and art auctions). Xpal off-chain payment channel networks can provide instant transaction approvals in seconds by lowest fee through its share gas system. charging a nominal fee proportional to the payment amount. Such attraction on payment channel networks inspired many recent studies which focus on how to design them and allocate channels such that the transactions will be secure and efficient.

I also remember seeing someone putting some interesting data on mentions of different coins that are made in this group. 

Putting the two together, has anyone done an experiment where they’ve somehow scraped data from this subreddit and then purchased the coins that have the greatest change in positive mentions from one month to another?

E.g if four months ago there had been 78 posts essentially saying ‘bullish on ONE’ and then three months back 873 posts saying ‘bullish on ONE’ they’d bought ONE and held for a set amount of time, before then selling and repeating the process after a set interval (e.g a quarter) and doing it with the next coin (for the sake of argument, let’s say we are now seeing lots of posts saying ‘bullish on CRO’ so, having seen out a quarter with ONE, they might then move this investment to CRO? 

Tl;dr - has anyone ever put into place a logical system to feed off this sub’s overall sentiment and if so have they profited?"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3569015|public|self|Has anyone done this experiment?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q54rap/has_anyone_done_this_experiment/|all_ads|6|1633838190.0|DISCUSSION|87049662-0882-11e5-82e1-0e9d1a9f7761|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-10-10 09:26:30+00:00|t3_q54rap|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||10_10_21|10_21|0.08798095|0.4706187|0.44140035|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.05708480626344681|0.21451924741268158|0.014078743755817413|0.21398550271987915|0.4815766215324402|0.01875513233244419

&gt;As many of you know we have kind of cracked down a bit on off-topic conversation in the daily discussion, so we have added this as another outlet where users can hang out and chat about (almost) anything. There are only \~100 users right there now, so it may be a little quiet, but we think we have the tools in place to announce it here and see if there is more interest in people using it. There are also channels on our community discord where you are (more) free to just hand out and shoot the shit, so to speak as well

Could you share with me some coins/token/ blockchains/resources and a brief explanation of their ambition?

Working some industry jobs I’ve seen how old tech is plaguing some big companies. It seems the stars are aligning opportunities in blockchain/ crypto tech will fundamentally change the business environment.

Now when I checked out my holdings yesterday morning I was completely unfazed and just had a “oh that’s nice”  and got ready for work. And it just really hit me that if I chose to liquidate I would have more money than I have ever seen in my life. Yet when looking at it in my portfolio it was just numbers on a screen.

Today, I want to talk about why Decentralised Social Media is (IMO) the next smart move, and the future for all users and content creators.

**Problems of Centralised Social Media**

* A handful of private companies effectively control public discourse, and earn monopoly profits off of content that they don't even create.
* The creators who actually produce this content are underpaid and under-engaged due to an outdated ads-driven business model.
* The ads-driven business model also forces social media companies to keep a walled garden around content created on their platforms, preventing external developers from innovating or building apps on top of it.

Don't get me wrong, there's surely value in combining all of the content into a single pool, since it allows for curation at a global scale, but whoever we put in charge of maintaining the pool is ultimately going to become a centralised gatekeeper like what we have today.

**So what's the Solution?**

Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown that dominant platforms can be built around open code and open data. And, the more open they are and the more people that build on top of them, the more value accrues to Bitcoin and Ethereum holders.

If this model can be extended to social media and to the outdated ads-driven business models, we could start putting social media content into a public blockchain, rather than giving it to a handful of private companies to monopolize. Publishers could contribute to a public data pool that nobody controls and that they'll never be dis-intermediated from. Thus we could move from a world in which data is a heavily guarded, privately-owned resource to one in which it is more like a globally accessible utility that anyone can build on.

**Fancy words - I want to know the Benefits!**

Sure. Social tokens, Social NFTs, and Social tipping could give creators unprecedented reach, and a more direct relationship with their followers. And as long as the Decentralised Social Media is open-source, everyone can contribute to its code. For example, think of a major creator who wants to start offering premium content in exchange for a monthly subscription. With an open-source code, all it takes is for one person on the internet to build this feature, and the entire ecosystem gets access to it instantly. The same goes for other features like an inbox where creators can be paid to repost content, or paid to answer messages from their followers. And this goes for other things like detecting harmful content or weeding out spam, where the best machine learning researchers in the world can build solutions, with access to the full firehose of data, without asking for permission, no matter where they are.

Finally, we could use this technology to rank content more effectively and lower the spread of fake news. Ultimately, creating a more peaceful, secure and self-governed ecosystem enabling freedom of speech, fair content monetisation and prevent misinformation."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3570744|public|self|Why we need Decentralised Social Media to Work!|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q5dg50/why_we_need_decentralised_social_media_to_work/|all_ads|6|1633869935.0|ADVICE|c1034ee6-9c2a-11e3-a8c4-12313b0e8e20|ANALYSIS|||||||||||2021-10-10 18:15:35+00:00|t3_q5dg50|0|12|0.76||3||[]|False|True|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||10_10_21|10_21|0.09943512|0.50272423|0.39784065|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0823168158531189|0.11424129456281662|0.01224549487233162|0.49923110008239746|0.2819773554801941|0.009987949393689632

I have an idea for a cryptocurrency that I was hoping to get feedback/thoughts from you folks.

Idea's very simple: cryptocurrency that rewards users for transacting in it (and thus incentivizes use/adoption of itself).   
Similar concept in traditional finance - cashback and rewards on credit cards - has been widely adopted by most, if not all, card brands.

We have made a Proof of Concept - it's functional, here's a diagram that summarizes idea and adds some details on how it works.  


[Vincentiv - PoC of cryptocurrency that rewards users transacting in it.](https://preview.redd.it/2mgurab3nis71.png?width=1850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98ccd6d24984bfa6853386f1f63fc7da129dc8f8)

More details are available on [website](https://www.vincentiv.net/) \- there's a working testnet and blockchain explorer that you can use to see it in action.

Questions for the community:

TomoChain is also host to a varied range of blockchain products. Each of the products below is an essential element of the TomoChain ecosystem, creating an all-in-one platform for a range of different use cases.

**TomoWallet**

TomoWallet is the native wallet used across the TomoChain ecosystem. Secure, and easy to navigate, TomoWallet can be used for storing the TomoChain coin (TOMO), and any TomoChain-issued tokens. Also, TomoWallet is used to track user rewards, voting for TomoChain Masternodes, and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto gaming platforms built on the blockchain.

**TomoMaster**

TomoMaster is an application used for staking, tracking rewards, and voting on which Masternodes will be eligible to secure the TomoChain blockchain. Furthermore, TomoMaster provides statistics relating to the performance of 150 Masternodes.

**TomoScan**

TomoScan is the native TomoChain block explorer. Similar to Etherscan, but with additional enhancements, TomoScan provides transparent on-chain analytics displaying technical visualizations of network activity.

**TomoBridge**

TomoBridge is a token swap and bridge application that allows TomoChain to interact with other blockchains. With TomoBridge, users can swap tokens from one blockchain to another using a simple graphical user interface (GUI).

**TomoRelayer**

TomoRelayer is the dashboard used to register, launch, and maintain a decentralized exchange (DEX) built using the TomoX Protocol.

**LuaSwap**

LuaSwap is a cross-chain liquidity protocol that enables users to make swaps between the TOMO, ETH, and various ERC-20 and TRC-21 tokens. Furthermore, LuaSwap enables users to earn a passive income with crypto. This is achieved by providing liquidity, and staking the native LUA token.

**TomoIssuer**

TomoIssuer is an application that uses TomoZ protocol for issuing TRC-21 tokens. It provides a user-friendly dashboard and back-end functionality to issue TRC-21 tokens quickly and efficiently.

**TomoStats**

TomoStats is the TomoChain dashboard for network status. This is where you’ll find important metrics such as the current number of TomoChain Masternodes and how they are performing. Other metrics include block time, confirmation time, transactions per second (TPS), and transaction finality.

**TomoStatus**

TomoStatus is the TomoChain system monitoring dashboard. It provides both historical and real-time data along with key insights about the system performance of the TomoChain product range."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3571744|public|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/R7diPEf5e-5IPysJuaOJcHc1HRDkG5C0eRHcTsx1G_E.jpg|What you need to know about TomoChain products|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q5io1f/what_you_need_to_know_about_tomochain_products/|all_ads|6|1633886366.0|DISCUSSION||DISCUSSION|||78.0|140.0|||||||2021-10-10 22:49:26+00:00|t3_q5io1f|0|2|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]|||{'rjz3o0rdcps71': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'rjz3o0rdcps71', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/rjz3o0rdcps71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98e871c0821b012aad6ec043960a0ffa3cf5bd21', 'x': 108, 'y': 60}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/rjz3o0rdcps71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e39aec3111f5ce8b12d4676e0f07aa49039f7350', 'x': 216, 'y': 121}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/rjz3o0rdcps71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d4503ea16b0791195e30ca6d99bc2f662ba9b56', 'x': 320, 'y': 179}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/rjz3o0rdcps71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5cf22e5ffa1b15b991b74c03679018c083d51e7', 'x': 640, 'y': 359}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/rjz3o0rdcps71.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e535bab44b58a356137eb2bf23529f081feb2ab', 'x': 960, 'y': 538}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/rjz3o0rdcps71.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd890a398d7fa097b63d55f8e742ce1f90d34e9e', 'x': 1080, 'y': 606}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/rjz3o0rdcps71.png?width=1678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4881cfa543bca377f605c89303d66ce3c8814047', 'x': 1678, 'y': 942}, 'status': 'valid'}}|[]||False|False|||||||||||||||10_10_21|10_21|0.09943512|0.50272423|0.39784065|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0823168158531189|0.11424129456281662|0.01224549487233162|0.49923110008239746|0.2819773554801941|0.009987949393689632

He would have lost all his money. I asked him what limit order and stop loss meant and he looked at me like I spoke in Spanish.

People ""buy the dip"" for the short term with the expectation that every dip will immediately lead to a moonshot. This rarely happens. Nor does the average person have any form of entry or exit in mind. I learned the hard way when I bought a bunch of LTC and ETH, and some BTC, in late 2017 when I didn't know much about crypto or any type of financial market. When the market started to crash a few months later, I ended up with like $3 and eventually all my shit got liquidated after I deleted Coinbase and gave up, lol.

Technical analysis seems confusing at first but I learned most of the terminology in about a week.

It must be a place that I could get citizenship reasonably quickly (within a few months); it must also have low capital gains taxes and fast internet. I would like it to be someplace that is ""fun"" (decent nightlife, things to do), be friendly for high-frequency traders, have lots of other crypto people there, be highly democratic and be a decently populated 500k+. I would be willing to do Citizenship by Investment if it cost less than 200k USD.

I am definitely not an expert on investing and sure as hell don't know a quarter of what most people in this sub know, but I was thinking the other day that rich people that are willing to gamble are making way more off crypto than I ever will.....and they are not doing it by investing a bit at a time, which is the only way I can, but by controlling the market.

Every so often I see posts about ""a whale just bought a billion of ________ coin"" and then when I look at said coin.....well damn sure it is pumping.....I never see the post when that same ""whale"" sells off their big billion buy, but I'm sure that's what happens when that same coin starts to drop again. 

Isn't this just them controlling what coin pumps and then dumping once they see enough profit? 

Like as an example that I probably don't need to put: if they spend a million on some cheap coin at .20 and it pumps to .30 in a few hours and then they sell....didn't they just make 500 thousand? Then the FOMO people are the ones that don't cash out and loose because the coin then drops off? 

Is my thinking wrong? 

On a side note.....how do people know when a whale buys a ton of coins?"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3570819|public|self|Just a thought|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q5du0e/just_a_thought/|all_ads|6|1633871130.0|DISCUSSION|87049662-0882-11e5-82e1-0e9d1a9f7761|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-10-10 18:35:30+00:00|t3_q5du0e|0|6|0.8||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||10_10_21|10_21|0.12832753|0.4872703|0.384402|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.08182957768440247|0.21628962457180023|0.014073725789785385|0.42507535219192505|0.242714986205101|0.020016731694340706

One keynote, Amazon is working on a Steam competitor called Vapor. If you're unfamiliar with Steam it's the largest digital distribution platform for computer games. 

Now here's the kicker, Amazon, has been actively hiring Block Chain Strategists, a digital currency lead strategist and it's pretty obvious for Vapor to compete with Steam it'll have to do some pretty revolutionary things, but Amazon is capable of getting the job done and crypto friendly. 

I believe, the start will just be accepting crypto as payment for games but Vapor when launched in time could expand the horizon, considering Amazon has been making moves towards the space and Vapor is the perfect project to implement.

[Link to previous post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/q0k92m/basic_concept_i_wish_i_could_show_more_traders/). Many ideas covered in that post are still valid, but may not be included in this post.

[Bitcoin Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/mH809rYH/). Starting with this one as it helps dictate my strategy and explains why I am still on the sidelines. I am an altcoin trader, if you like Bitcoin, you can use this EXACT chart but with a different mindset. BTC.D has been running hard, and we got a good bitcoin rally. It could happen again, but Im not here to predict the future. There are pretty even chances of this week being red or green for the market. And I dont trade unless the odds are on my side. Keep in mind, Bitcoin dominance can go up or down regardless of price action. It just tends to show strong moves so never trade solely on this chart, use it as a supplement. Im really not showing much on this chart other than the BTC rally we had, and some common support levels. At some point, BTC.D will retrace (downward) without Bitcoin itself dumping, and this is when I go super heavy and make almost all of my money in crypto.

[Bitcoin 4hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/omN5DB8j/) price action has been respecting the small white parabolas. And it is fair to assume that a trend continues until you have a reason to believe otherwise. But when parabolic price action breaks, price action tends to drop very very fast so it is fair to hold right now, but have a plan if things turn south. And this parabola is coming up against some strong overhead resistance on much larger timeframes, which I show in the next link.

[Bitcoin 1D](https://www.tradingview.com/x/G5OkiFn5/) shows some of the macro trends at play. The blue trendline is strong overhead resistance. Seeing a retest to the grey falling channel would be great as Bitcoin would almost certainly bounce on that idea. But in a super bullish market that may not happen perfectly as buyers may front-run the retest to ensure their orders are filled.

And Im not going to show any TOTAL or USDT Dominance type of charts this time. I dont feel they add significant value right now as the ideas above are really going to set the tone for the market this week."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3571733|public|self|General Market Analysis 10-10-21|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q5ilgg/general_market_analysis_101021/|all_ads|6|1633886120.0|ADVICE|c1034ee6-9c2a-11e3-a8c4-12313b0e8e20||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'jRbaR_b7vK3NRH0GaGqR4tbMn8Os4p4gp5Oc2M6KBNo', 'resolutions': [{'height': 93, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zrj_5sg60hLgDptfIbffavydvGhTQRQVUAIuKxW90Ko.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e0110744aad664be65bedcf0854989784242564', 'width': 108}, {'height': 186, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zrj_5sg60hLgDptfIbffavydvGhTQRQVUAIuKxW90Ko.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b56de01b09bcfa984f34562776ab1429fe21ffc', 'width': 216}, {'height': 276, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zrj_5sg60hLgDptfIbffavydvGhTQRQVUAIuKxW90Ko.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0e821627d6ae3596d8a145123c04193341baf8a', 'width': 320}, {'height': 553, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zrj_5sg60hLgDptfIbffavydvGhTQRQVUAIuKxW90Ko.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e36811745ddcc02c29577e11abc468835c156fb', 'width': 640}, {'height': 830, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zrj_5sg60hLgDptfIbffavydvGhTQRQVUAIuKxW90Ko.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84f07297b815d18f6566bd670409d7e5adba7a5e', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 868, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/zrj_5sg60hLgDptfIbffavydvGhTQRQVUAIuKxW90Ko.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=6289122abc20d6ae98f5049f7b69e09afd4ce062', 'width': 1003}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||2021-10-10 22:45:20+00:00|t3_q5ilgg|0|2|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||10_10_21|10_21|0.09889186|0.4752179|0.42589024|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.09181936085224152|0.2768768072128296|0.01671096496284008|0.2734857499599457|0.32773882150650024|0.01336834579706192

I just wanted to make this post for all the ignorant people who are posting on this reddit.

Let's start saying that for 98% of the people in this subreddit everything that is not BTC, ETH or ADA is shit.

Well, wrong! You will find out that if you open your little mind of 1 or 2 inches more you could have made a bunch of money with other alt/shit/meme coins other than your beloved ones. But ok, it's your money your choice.

SHIB: a lot of people here says that SHIB is a shit coin, a Ponzi scheme (do you even know what that is?), and a lot of bullshits.

If you don't know a damn about something don't go talk shit about it just because you're not invested into it.

It's true it started as a memecoin but no longer is.

The team worked hard to give the community ShibaSwap, the whole shib ecosystem, NFTs, Certik audit, own Blockchain is coming, burning and it is used by a lot of shops all over the world many more will come. Not to mention the partnership with NOWPayments and the fact that it is list on all of the biggest exchanges out there.

You might say ShibaSwap is useless. Cool, for now it might be due to the ridiculous ETH gas fees, but once the Blockchain will be out ShibaSwap will be between the best out there. Just check at their rewards and tell me what other swap gives you this ? According to what uniswap or pancake are not a scam but Shiba is?

Least but not last, there is no way to compare shib with doge. I mean, I am happy for everybody who could make money with it, but you can't say that doge is a better coin when between the 2 it is the one with no purpose to exist.

I will finish here by saying that we are all in Cryptos to make money, and I don't give a bloody damn if one project looks better than another one, as long as the ""shitty"" one will make me more money it's a win win. 

Unfair for the good project? Yes

For my wallet?

From wikipedia:\n\n""A cypherpunk is any individual advocating widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change.""\n\nWith the increase in network tracking and KYC regulations tainting an increasing share of BTC\'s supply as dirty, is there really a future for public cryptos? I mean what is the point of crypto if the government regulates it? If only approved addresses can use use the network, it\'s just a really crappy bank. You might as well simply use the bank. I understand that people can simply choose to ignore the busybodies and accept ""dirty"" crypto, but then that is like a network within a network, and it kind of doesn\'t make much sense. Public ledger cryptos are not really fungible. To be fair, neither is cash, but at least with cash the KYC is restricted to banking and cross border movement and things of the sort, with public ledger crypto literally every vendor can check if you have dirty money or not and refuse to trade with you. I understand that a privacy coin has the issue that, if they can\'t track it, they\'ll just ban it outright, and the more they ban it the more it gets associated with criminal activity as normies choose not to take the risk, so it\'s not just part of the network that is blacklisted, it\'s the entire network. Did the thing making privacy coins illegal in the US pass? I think a big reason why some exchanges shy away from RVN is because if it is a network for ""issuing securities"" as it says on the sidebar, as soon as it gets big governments will say ""hold on a moment, this needs heavy regulation"". At least BTC can claim to be a ""commodity"", which is bs but whatever.\n\nBottom line is, this all feels like a bubble to me, even discounting the shibas and doges, people only care about gains, about institutional investors dumping truckloads of money in, about the government giving them the greenlight so more normies will join, etc. The only reason defi loans work is because people strongly believe their collateral will increase in value much faster than the interest they are paying. The idea of overcollaterizing your loans doesn\'t make much sense within a normal, stable economy. The freedom part of crypto has been almost completely forgotten and is being sacrificed for the sake of pumping the bubble higher. It almost makes me wonder if those guys that say BTC is a NSA trap aren\'t right. The actual stated purpose of crypto seems to have been forgotten. People talk of governments making their own cryptos as if that is a good thing, when that would literally be worse than what we have now, it would be a huge step towards 1984 total surveillance. The whole programmable crypto that ETH mainstreamed makes it even scarier.\n\nI don\'t think we should ignore these problems. If we want this to be a success, we should think very deeply about this, but I don\'t see people doing that. They are more worried about which exchange is going to list RVN and OC settings.

You can use it to take advantage of comparatively small price movements, ‘gear’ your portfolio for greater exposure, or to make your capital go further.

For example, let's say you want to buy
1000 coins of a crypto that's at a
price of $1. To open a conventional trade, you would be required to pay:
1000 x $1 for an exposure of $1000
(ignoring any commission or
other charges).

If the crypto's price goes up by 20p, your 1000 coins are now worth $1.20 each.
If you close your position, then you'd have made a $200 profit from your original $1000.

If the market had gone the other way and the price of the crypto had fallen by 20p, you would have lost $200, or a fifth of what you paid for the coins.

Or you could have opened your trade with a leveraged provider..


Here, you'd only have to pay 10% of your $1000
exposure, or £100, to open the position.
BUY $1200

If the company's share price rises to $1.20, you would still make the same profit of £200, but at a considerably
reduced cost. BUT, if the value had fallen by 20p then you would have lost €200, which is twice your initial investment.

Yes, it's true you can make a lot money, in a very short amount of time using leverage, but remember it's a double-edged sword. But, you MUST have the correct knowledge and strategies to do it profitably, and with consistent success. Trading with leverage has risks involved,
and you can lose just as quickly as you win."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3570880|public|self|What is leverage trading?

Basically there is 2 things it looks like it is coming down to.

1. Blue - The price will bounce off the upper channel for a bit. Maybe for the next day or so. Maybe less. But it will break outward to the top. Chances are it won't be a clean jump like I'm showing. Chances are we will bounce off $65k and when we break through that then we get another run.
2. Red - We bounce off of the top and bottom for a bit and eventually we will hit our targets. 

Big thing to note is with blue, we should hit the peak before Feb. Most likely around Nov or Dec. 

Red- the bull run will last until mid to late next year. But while this slow growth might seem bad, we are going to have a stronger foundation. So when the end really happens and we get super volatile. We will see much much much bigger gains. Note it's an educated guess because there isn't enough data yet. But I expect in the blue we can peak between $120k-$250k. The red I expect $500k at the lowest.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously there is a chance the market can collapse. But if I have to give a % on that. I expect it to be closer to 10% likely and shrinking. Note late week it was a 40% or 46% likely. We already passed the critical point in this price and we kept out stability. NOTE: with the red line this does increase. Depending on how sharp the dips are is depending on things. But I expect if the red line is true the channel will change and shrink in width. 

NOTE: None of this is financial or investment advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

The boxes (green, red, and purple) are support and resistance zones.

1. Conduct an ungodly amount of trades on an ungodly amount of exchanges, making transfers back and forth between multiple wallets

2. Stake some, swap one crypto for another. Over and over.

3. After months or years of doing this, ask if you need to report this on your taxes, and how to calculate it.

Trust me… It is much easier to figure out your taxes if you start out by tracking everything properly from the beginning. It is very difficult trying to figure it out after conducting hundreds or thousands of transactions on different platforms using different wallets&amp;exchanges. In my country the exchanges that operate here share our transaction information with the government. If we don’t report anything or anything we provide inaccurate information we could be in for some trouble.. 

Examples of things to know:

1. What is considered a taxable event
2. Tax implications of day trading/swing trading vs hodling
3. Whether crypto gains are taxable in your country 
4. If gains are taxable, figure out how to track your transactions and calculate gains and losses

It’s run through a browser so you can still open other tabs and do whatever while the original tab mines. It’s not going to make you rich overnight, but some money is better than no money. And if you leave your phone idling or are on websites (like Reddit) most of the day, this is an easy way to make money.

Despite what I read on the internet about it from comments years old (maybe due to tech advances since then), I’ve had no overheating problems. And it’s not even affecting my battery that much. From my experience so far, I’ve seen that it doesn’t slow down my device and it’s made me my first Bitcoin. I’m super happy with it so I just wanted to spread the word.

However, I have no background in technology and so I never really knew how to do it. A few weeks ago, however, I saw a person post about minting coins on the Harmony blockchain.

I decided to give it a shot. This wasn’t an attempt to get rich or change the world. I was just curious how easy it would be to make a shitcoin and how it would work providing liquidity and trading it.

I set up a new burner wallet with MetaMask, added the Harmony RPC, and minted a token called Gonzo Coin (HST) on [TokenJenny](https://tokenjenny.one/). After I had decided on the name (a tribute to my favorite author) and the circulating supply (420 million) it took all of 30 seconds and less than one penny to mint my token.

https://preview.redd.it/w5hpx743zis71.png?width=1395&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8abb56c24624b25e9b03f33826b8998b38d7fb3

 So now I was the proud owner of a shitty meme coin. Eat my ass, SHIB and DOGE.

But of course a coin that no one can buy is worthless, so I headed over to [ViperSwap](https://viperswap.one/) and set up a liquidity pair. I put $10 of USDC and 10 HST into a pair, making the price $1 per HST. Suddenly I was now worth a staggering $420 million.

It felt good to have nearly a half billion dollars to my name, but it felt better to finally understand how easy it was to do this crap. All those scammers on Telegram and the moonshot subreddits suddenly seemed even more pathetic.

The next question was how easily I could actually buy and sell my own token. Note: I am not a scammer and had no interest in dumping this piece of shit on the general public, so I told no one and shilled it nowhere. However, I did want to learn the mechanics of moving the market. Would buying my own token up it up in value? Would selling push it down? It seemed logical.

I made a few tiny trades with ridiculously trivial sums of money and saw that I could indeed push the price up or down a few percent. However, with just $20 of liquidity, there wasn’t much I could do.

I soon forgot about HST and went back to my regular life, secure in the knowledge that I was almost halfway to being a billionaire. But one day I was hungover and bored and thought it might be interesting to play around a little more.

I looked at the [ViperSwap info page](https://info.viper.exchange/token/0x74ebebeee28e57c0978c4648bd288c7404950c37) for my coin and found that it had actually *increased* in value by about 30% during the week I had been away from it. I have no idea how that happened because neither I nor anyone else purchased it. But that strange pump had pushed my personal net worth to over $500 million! Bring it on, Elon. Watch out, Bezos. I’m coming for you guys.

I bridged $50 of BNB across to Harmony and converted it to ONE (the native Harmony token). With the stupidly low fees on Harmony, it was basically free to do this. However, the $0.00001 spent on transaction fees ended up costing me **more than a half a billion dollars**.

https://preview.redd.it/cnku9k58zis71.png?width=1867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=563be20a300cd4bfb2ade0ac604a2618ffab106a

 Apparently, I am about as good at maths as I am at tech stuff and instead of adding my $50 of ONE alongside an amount of HST that would have continued to peg its value at about $1 (in fact, it had risen to about $1.30), I sadly miscalculated and added too many HST tokens.

I went back to the ViperSwap info page and saw that my token had plummeted in value by a staggering 95% in just a matter of seconds. I was broke. Ruined. Roughly $500 million lost! I felt like Zuckerberg after Facebook went down.

Well, let this be a lesson for all of you – nay, several lessons. 1) It is sickeningly easy to make a shitty meme coin. If I can do it, literally *anyone* can. 2) If you’re not a complete idiot like me, it is insanely easy to manipulate the price, too, so don't FOMO into stupid projects. 3) Money is easily lost in this game. In addition to my $500 million in assets, I lost about $8 of USDC. There go my dinner plans.

\*

*Note: This post was for educational purposes and – to some small extent – comedic ones. I personally do not buy meme coins and only did this to learn a few things. My coin still exists, though it is but a shadow of its former self. Do* ***not*** *buy it and do not buy any other crappy tokens with thin liquidity. Crypto is a great thing, but scams abound.

I have traditionally used Binance and Kraken depending on what I want to buy. I used to use [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/)

Kraken have so few trading pairs and charge over double Binance charge for transferring USDT

Crypto.com are charging 2.99% on all card transactions!
