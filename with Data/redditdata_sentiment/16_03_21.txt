As a developer, I was initially sold on Cardano due to its research-backed approach and emphasis on doing things the “right way”. I began learning Haskell and Plutus in preparation for the Alonzo HF. I bought 10s of thousands of ADA and started a Stake Pool. This slow-but-sure approach helped me justify the poor development documentation, the unrealised hype (birds), and the general unpolished nature of the Cardano ecosystem. This was before I came across Algorand.

Having used Algorand for a few weeks now I can confidently say that this is everything I’d hoped Cardano would be and more. Transactions happen in seconds, not minutes. I don’t need to stake to a pool to earn rewards, and I’m guaranteed rewards; no more Slot Leader Lotteries that favour wealthy stake pools. The development documentation is second-to-none, and it’s easy to find relevant information. 

I have since moved all my holdings to Algorand.

Having some perspective now, I can see why people become evangelical about Cardano. There is a cult of personality around Charles, who is clearly a visionary but comes off a bit disingenuous sometimes. He builds hype and teases announcements that often don’t eventuate, breaking trust and leaving people wondering what to believe. The project has a lot of promise, and I believe it has the potential to do a lot of good in developing parts of the world, but as it currently stands I think it is over-hyped and over-valued."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1912125|public|self|From Cardano to Algorand|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m5w5qe/from_cardano_to_algorand/|all_ads|6|1615834116.0|FOCUSED-DISCUSSION||FOCUSED-DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-03-16 00:18:36+00:00|t3_m5w5qe|0|4|0.64||0||[]|True|False|[]||||[]|||||1615854059.0|||||||||||||16_03_21|03_21|0.14445342|0.5298369|0.3257096|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.08460193127393723|0.26939502358436584|0.01669912412762642|0.4251999855041504|0.19285431504249573|0.011249514296650887

I am a certified public accountant (**not** an artist) that is based out of New Jersey, and I'm continuing my extensive guide covering the interactions of United States tax law and cryptocurrency. You can see links to previous parts on the bottom of the post.

Note: gifts are one of the more complex areas of tax law, and treatment can vary significantly. The below is a **general** overview.

## What is considered a gift?

A gift is any transfer of money or property where full consideration is not received in return.

You purchasing coffee for a friend is a gift, just like receiving a present on Christmas is.

This broad definition means that almost every single taxpayer interacts with gift tax laws multiple times a year.

## Who has to pay gift tax?

Gift taxes are almost always paid by the donor, the recipient doesn't have to think about the tax consequences unless they end up **selling their gift**.

## When are gifts 'taxable'?

Any gift is a a taxable gift, unless it falls under any of the following exclusion:

1. Gifts that are less than or equal to the annual exclusion for the year.
2. Gifts that cover tuition or medical expenses.
3. Gifts to your spouse.
4. Gifts to a political organization.

Gifts to charities are also excluded from gift tax laws, and the value of the gift is deductible.

## What is the annual exclusion?

The annual exclusion is an amount that changes as times goes on. For tax years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, that amount is $15,000.

This exclusion means that a donor may gift up to $15,000 per person before they have to file [Form 709](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f709.pdf).

This annual exclusion is why the gift tax is rarely relevant for most tax payers. Unless you gift $15,000 of money or property to one person in a year, you will never have to file the gift tax form.

## I gifted more than the annual exclusion to one person. Now what?

If you end up gifting money or property worth more than $15,000, you'll have to file Form 709 where you describe the details of the gift.

The amount over the $15,000 annual exclusion is then applied to your lifetime limit, which is $11,580,000 in 2020.

This lifetime exclusion means that even people that do have to file a gift tax form are generally not required to pay any tax on the gift.

## Does the donee have any filing requirements?

Generally: no. A donee does not have to do anything for receiving a gift.

However, when a donee receives property, they should know the original cost basis of the asset, and the date that it was purchased if it's something they may eventually sell or exchange, like cryptocurrency.

## What is the donee's adjusted basis? What about the holding period?

The adjusted basis changes depending on whether your have a gain or loss.

* If you will have a gain: your basis is equal to the donor's basis (generally the purchase price)
* If you will have a loss: your basis is the lesser of:
   * the donor's basis
   * the fair market value when received

This treatment maximizes your gain, and minimizes your loss.

If you aren't able to substantiate the donor's basis, then your basis will be 0.

The holding period of the property will include the time it was held by the donor.

## What happens when a donee sells a gift?

Let's pretend a husband and wife purchase a car for $20,000. The model becomes sought after by collectors of vintage sports cars. They decide to move, and give the to car to the child, when the fair market value is $100,000.

The husband and wife would file Form 709, as the fair market value of the gift is greater than $15,000. They would apply the difference, $85,000, to their lifetime exclusion.

The child decides to sell the car five years later, for $125,000. The child would record a long-term capital gain of $105,000.

## Are there any special rules about cryptocurrency?

As far as I can tell, cryptocurrency doesn't have any specific rules related to gift taxes.

The main concern when it comes to the gift tax is a need for proper documentation. If you plan to gift cryptocurrency, you should make sure the recipient knows your basis and purchase date. This is especially true as it is more than likely the case that they will convert it into another crypto or fiat currency, creating a taxable event.

## A couple of random things

This is just some random information about gift taxes that may or may not be relevant to you:

* The US tax laws for international gift giving are the same. You can send and receive gifts to and from foreign people following the same rules as if they were a United States citizen. Although, foreign people generally do not have filing requirements in the United States. If you receive a gift from a foreign person, you may have to file Form 3520 (&gt; $100,000).
* Having property inherited is far better than having property gifted. When property is inherited through an estate, the adjusted basis for the recipient becomes the fair market value at the time the property is received. This provides you with a tax free 'step-up' which could save the recipient **a lot** of money on taxes if they do decide to sell.

## In Conclusion

Hopefully you were able to get a grasp of how gift tax rules work in the United States. Ultimately, only the very wealthy manage to 'suffer' the consequences of the gift tax law. The main concern, as it always is with cryptocurrency, is to retain proper documentation to ensure you know the value of what you're gifting, and what you're receiving.

I have a little leftover BTC in Binance from when I was doing tests with crypto years ago, it's very little (0.00016974 BTC / 9.50 USD).

I just want to send all of it to Bittrex in order to consolidate my coins. However, when trying to do so, [I have these options and fees](https://i.imgur.com/a1kobUd.png).

The fees for BTC or ETH are automatically over the amount I have, so it is not applicable, and BEP2/BEP20 give me warning asking to double check the receiving end supports it.

Could you please let me know if it is safe to use BEP2 or BEP20 to send from Binance to Bittrex? Otherwise, should I just consider it a loss and move on?

Thanks,

I'm a young professional who has just recently started investing in Crypto.

I am sorry to say that Crypto has not saved my life, get me off drugs, or anything of that nature; I am just merely interested in diversifying my portfolio.

I tried to play around with day-trading shit coins and real coins, but that is just not a worthwhile strategy, so from here on out I'm officially a HODLer.

Most of my crypto investments going forward will be going into ETH, but I have a soft-spot for BAT. Of all the altcoins I've looked at, I have really enjoyed the BAT and the Brave Browser; I truly believe it is a fantastic idea.

I just want to know what everyone else thought of BAT? Is it worth its current price point, more? Does BAT/Brave have long term sustainability? Or is a shitcoin in disguise?

Thanks for your thoughtful comments!

Long story short, I just realised I have some Nanos holding from the 2017-18 debacle and I just remembered.

They were in the original RaiWallet that come to be called Nano wallet and I found them and are safe and sound after all these years.

However, I'd love to trade with them and actually get a bigger sum of em. In which exchange would you recommend me trade with them? Can't seem to be able to deposit either on kucoin or Binance... Maybe I'm just a noob but can't seem to do it...

Hope you're all sound and keeping well. I am new to CRYPTO Currency and today for some reasons I was noting down what are the lessons I have learned so far while getting into this fabulous world and rather than keeping those notes to myself, I thought why not list them down here and maybe you guys could add, sharpen some points or recommend things for newbies like me to work on and improved.

I like to call them the Principles of Trading:

* Trade what you can afford to lose. I've read about so many people losing their mind when they were actually trying to add some profit to x amount. Even if this case you have to be careful as the market is not predictable. Anything can happen. Always trade what you can afford to lose so that you can make better decision in critical time and cut your losses if you hit rock bottom.
* When a Crypto Currency hit a new ATH, wait for it to reach a support then lookout for the dips. I'm not sure about this one and will appreciate the veterans inputs. My lesson is when a coin hits is all new high, those who don't have it, hit FOMO and then buy shares impulsively and later regret it. Take a breath, chill down and wait to see some stabilization/ support and then act.
* Make your OWN RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS - YES, it takes time and maybe you don't know anything but I reassure you that once you learn the curves, you will be the only one who benefit most from this. You are putting your own money at risk, the least you can do is to make sure you know in what you're investing. Of course it's good to ask for advice, thoughts and suggestion but again do your own homework and then act when you made your mind.
* Don't do impulsive buying - I read a nice post today about it's not fun being your own bank and that's so true to me. If you do an impulsive buying without proper analysis and research you might feel bad or worse regret it later. Again think twice before you act and trade what you can afford to lose.
* When you are in a verge of making a big decision you are not sure or don't feel completely sure, I try to sleep it off. The market will always be there and honestly in my humble opinion, if you are trading what you can afford to lose, a share going from 0.6 to 0.3 (just an example) isn't a reason to fail or go against all your invested time. Have some faith in what you initially believe and sometime ""times"" heals everything. Rather than making a rush/panic decision that you might regret later, take it deep breath, take a different approach, think it thoroughly and then ACT. Sleep sometimes can be the best advisor.
* Be selective on what you read and chose to adopt. The internet is full of articles, blogs, forums, books, videos and other medium contents to advise you. That doesn't mean that all of them are right. Welcome ideas and suggestion but again before you act, MAKE YOUR OWN RESEARCH. Even if you aren't so sure about it; go in because you believe in such and such points. If you're wrong, learn from it and don't repeat the same mistake. Moreover, if you're wrong, you just lost what you could afford to lose right ? 
* Treat this as a learning experience and exciting journey to potentially achieve your goals (For some a Lambo, being debt free, a trip to some exotic place or like me; Financial Freedom). If you have a dream, you gonna work for it and earn it in my belief. I believe whatever you think, you can achieve but it won't fall down on you randomly. It will require some efforts, time, perseverance and determination. Also, my personal opinion when you lose; don't take it as failure. Use it as a learning curve making it a gained experience to improve your next strategy.

Voila, that's all for me. I would love and  will be happy if others could add more or suggest on the above. As I said, I'm no expert but that just 2 cents in this fabulous world I've joined in recently.

P.s: Sorry for the typo errors. Looking forward to hear your feedback.

**Pick yourself UP and together let's HODL to the MOON :)**

This is big news for anyone excited about Cardano.

Coinbase will support ADA in all of its jurisdictions. In the meantime, the platform will only support Shelley addresses (One of Cardano’s addresses that starts with the prefix “addr1”). Later on, Coinbase will enable full support for the Byron (legacy) wallet.

 Coinbase Pro plans to launch order books in three phases. Post-only, limit-only, and full trading while some of these phases may last longer than others depending on certain factors. The exchange plans to provide updates when each of these phases starts via Twitter.

Years ago, in a time before cryptocurrency, when the internet was still a bit new. There was a lady who worked at a modest 9-5pm job, making it by the best she knew how. 
 Influenced by a drive to better herself, she decided to take a risk and started to invest small amounts of her meager paychecks into different markets. She did not let her inexperience at investing hold her back, she began learning what she could about the subject. 
  While studying investments one day she realized a diverse portfolio was more beneficial than a restricted portfolio. She began happily buying into affordable stocks akin to a penny stock. The woman couldn’t afford to pay for financial advisors so she spread her buys out alphabetically. She bought a few stocks beginning with the letter “A”, then bought a few stocks with the letter “B”, and so on... This continued every paycheck for a few years and her portfolio was grew little by little over time, her portfolio wasn’t rich but it wasn’t doing bad either.

 A few years older and later the lady starts thinking about her retirement and how can she save more money for retirement? She lived a humble life and didn’t have much saved. About that same time of the year she gets a letter in the mail from her stock broker company. She figured it was just another monthly balance sheet and she filed it away with the others, no need to look at it because she was invested for the long haul, HOLD’ing before it was cool haha.
 All that week she keeps getting missed calls and messages on her telephone’s answering machine from her stock broker’s company. Suspecting bad news she decides to call them back but she needs to hurry because she’s on her lunch break using the pay phone booth outside the diner she works at.  
 It turns out one of the stocks she bought into had a huge pump. The stock was a new tech like company that allowed people at home to print text on paper using their machines. The name of that company was Xerox and their stock went through the atmosphere past the moon into the outer realms of the solar system! She was rich. Instant retirement. She could afford financial advisors now and they helped her invest her new wealth to make sure she never lost it. 
The woman remained modest and humble at heart, helping others when she could and doing right by people. 

I don’t know her true name or the true details of her story but it’s an older investing story that’s been around since been around. 
If there is a moral to be found here it would be the importance of diversity as opposed to just buying the same 2 coins every paycheck. I’ve also heard it described as not keeping all your eggs in the same basket? Oh well, it’s a nice story and a little food for thought."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1918329|public|self|The lady who accidentally knew what she was doing.|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m6m2v2/the_lady_who_accidentally_knew_what_she_was_doing/|all_ads|6|1615916394.0|TRADING|b0dd934c-ad7d-11e7-8466-0e3335a91874|TRADING|||||||||||2021-03-16 23:09:54+00:00|t3_m6m2v2|0|0|0.5||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||16_03_21|03_21|0.1058338|0.4481893|0.44597685|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.06887347251176834|0.13158805668354034|0.01260214764624834|0.5141336917877197|0.26247766613960266|0.010325027629733086

I have several ideas for NFTs I'd like to create and auction off but it seems like the issue for average joe's like me would be the marketing aspect. Celebrities and well known artists have a much easier time generating interest in their NFTs than I anticipate having.

Because with moons, we are “voting”, and our vote generate value. This is a concept where you can democratically link people’s opinion to capital. 

Imagine this scenario: r/cryptocurrency wants to create a small community project. For example, the community wants to develop an open sources app, or web tools for cryptocurrency trading, start educational programs, or raise awareness with an ad campaign. You vote for the project that you prefer, and with votes, each project receives its funding. Something similar to platforms like GoFundMe or Kickstarter, but it’s a really cool futuristic concept where **you can crowdfund a project by just voting for it.**

On larger scale (in a utopian world) this concept might be also usable for things like how and where your tax is spent. The fact is, it is a true democratic financial model because it is not a winner-take-all situation: your vote, is directly your contribution.

If there's another subreddit I should post this to (or a guide I just missed) please direct me there. I apologize in advance. I am *brand new* to the whole crypto scene. 

I am a gamer and have been trying to get ahold of a 3080 since launch. I finally got one after hitting Microcenter at 5AM for three days straight. I've been having a blast with it! 

Anyway, after [seeing the video Linus did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swOj0wvuCO8) I figured it was silly to leave money on the table. I installed NiceHash to mine while I'm at work and asleep. So far I've gotten around $9 in less than a day. Not baller money but I'd definitely pick up a tenner off my front lawn if I saw it laying there. 

The problem is I'm trying to find a wallet to dump my funds into. I do have a coinbase account that I put $10 into as an experiment, but I'm not sure that's the best choice. 

I plan to ""Hold like Hell"" because I fully believe that over the long term Bitcoin will continue to rise in value. I don't want to leave the money in the NiceHash wallet, but I'm struggling to find one that I'm comfortable with. 

I *really* want to be in control of my wallet. I'm not thrilled with the idea of an exchange disappearing overnight. 

I initially looked at Trezor / Ledger, but it looks like you can only unlock those using their website. That means if they go out of business I lose access to my money. It looks like they're essentially only offering 2FA with a hardware token. 

I thought about a paper wallet, but I'm not thrilled with the security on that. 

I know we're talking about small amounts of money here, but I'm looking at it as a second savings account. What's the best option for hodling whatever I get from mining plus any extra cash I decide to drop in when the bear market returns?"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1918054|public|self|Trying to Pick a Wallet...

Many people are paranoid about what they could lead to as they don't understand it. **I hail from the world's largest democracy and so far I think the real challenge for our government enabling widespread use of cryptocurrency is that it could be used by terrorists and criminals as a means of extending their agenda.**

&amp;#x200B;

First of all should that even concern the government or should we be more concerned about fighting terrorism in other ways rather than disabling their means of currency exchange? We could employ our forces in tracing and penetrating criminal social networks instead. How are pro-cryptocurrency countries handling it? 

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of people being concerned that cryptocurrencies are a threat to democracy and I find no sense in that. Governments should be more bold and should not the avoid the fights that are inevitable.

It has some of the highest volume on the market because it facilitates exchange and the ability to park your gains temporarily without converting to fiat. Current market cap: $38.7B. They recently settled with the AG in New York over fraud investigations for $18.5M with some stipulations. [Reuters link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-ifinex-settlement/bitfinex-tether-owner-pays-18-5-million-fine-to-settle-nyag-cryptocurrency-cover-up-charges-idUSKBN2AN1NM).

I haven't seen a good summary of the settlement agreement anywhere, so hopefully this is somewhat useful. Disclaimer: I'm not very smart, so besides the parts I'm taking directly from the document, take this with a healthy amount of salt.

Effective Date of the settlement: 2021/02/18 

90 days from the Effective Date AKA deadline: 2021/05/19

# Findings
Note: Bitfinex neither confirms nor denies any of this, but did agree to the settlement.

### 2017 Backing issue
* Tether's bank accounts are supposed to back USDT 1:1, and they did claim to do so at this time.
* Wells Fargo stopped accepting their wire transfers in late March, so they had to switch banks. 
* Tether opened an acct with Bank of Montreal in September which never had more than $61.5M in it.
* At this time there were 442M tether in circulation, backed by only $61.5M. The remaining was backed by receivables (IOU) from Bitfinex, in a comingled account. Bitfinex _did_ have this money as verified by Friedman LLP.
* Tl;dr Bitfinex had the funds instead of Tether, so from June to September, 442M USDT wasn't backed by their ""own"" assets.

### 2019 Loss of assets to Crypto Capital and reserve misrepresentation
* Bitfinex used Crypto Capital (CrC for brevity) for payment processing. PoC was named ""Oz""
* By 2018, CrC held $1B of Bitfinex deposits.
* CrC supposedly had an account frozen in Poland with &gt;$340M. Oz claimed this was temporary, and Bitfinex money was fine, but evaded transferring them the money with BS excuses (""bankers on vacation"" lol).
* Between April 2018 and July 2018, Oz told Bitfinex that $150M of client money was frozen in Portugal. 
* In July, Bitfinex had over 80% of client deposits with CrC, and $500M ""frozen"" with CrC (I'm unsure if it was actually frozen or if Oz just wouldn't give it to them). Bitfinex still told people to use CrC.
* Bitfinex borrowed $400M from Tether throughout summer 2018 to stave off the ""temporary liquidity crisis"". 
* In November, Tether opened an acct with Deltec, and published a doc with Deltec letterhead confirming that they had $1.83B in their acct as of Oct 31. 
* The next day, they transferred $475M to Bitfinex. Bitfinex at the same time purchased 150M USDT via CrC (frozen assets). Neither txn was disclosed.
* So once again, a large amount of USDT was unbacked because funds were sitting in Bitfinex's acct.
* In Feb 2019, they quietly changed their wording about USDT backing to include other assets.
* Between late 2018 and March 2019, Bitfinex opened a line of credit from Tether which retroactively included $625M (475 + 150) already transferred. This was collateralized with Digifinex shares, Bitfinex's parent company.
* Tl;dr 675M USDT went unbacked to cover ~$850M in Bitfinex funds held by Crypto Capital (maybe fraudulent?). They continued claiming this wasn't the case, and the transfers weren't disclosed. As of today, the money Bitfinex had with Crypto Capital cannot be accounted for.

# Consequencecs
$18.5M for the settlement. Not tax deductible. Paid in full, ensuring AG will not bring any claims against Bitfinex regarding the above matters **if** they do the following:

* Repay the full line of credit balance as of Jan 2021 (ambiguous wording. Is it supposed to be payed off by then, or is it the balance at that time? Couldn't find a report of them paying it off, so I assume it's the latter).
* Block all trading with New York people and entities. AG can ask for evidence this is being done. 
* Halt all business with New York entities besides KYC, Anti-Money Laundering, blockchain analysis or tracing, user risk scoring, legal services. 
* No OTC trading in New York.
* Reporting on business operations - By deadline (May 19), and following that, quarterly for 2 years, Bitfinex/Tether has to provide:
 * **Documents substantiating Tether's reserve acct(s) balance.** (Important!)
 * Verification that Bitfinex and Tether's accounts are separated and in order. Are tether reserves held separately from operating accts? Are Bitfinex and Tether accts separate? Are Bitfinex client accts separate from operating? Are virtual client funds segregated?
 * All documentation of transfers between Bitfinex and Tether.
* **Quarterly publication of Tether reserves for 2 years** (Important!). Tether will have to publish what percentage of its assets are cash, loans, securities, etc, also specifying if loans and receivables are from/to an affiliated entity. I don't know when they do this, but it's quarterly, so hopefully we get to see something by Q1 end. If not then, then by Q2 end.
* Transparency and opt-out from payment processors - By deadline (May 19), and quarterly for 2 years after:
 * Publish a list of pament processors, and all DD about payment processors they've done. This information excluding the DD must be available to users upon request.
 * Notify users and give them the option to opt out of using payment processors.

# My take on what this means
Short answer: No clue. Long answer: No fucking clue.

People are worried that tether is artificially pumping the price of crypto. Some interpret ""USDT is backed by cash and other assets"" as potentially USDT being backed by the crypto assets they're pumping. If this is the case, then when they stop printing, the crypto market could crash. On the other hand, others believe that the reliance on USDT is overstated since there's more transparent stablecoins in DAI and USDC and theoretically if the crash happens, it's overall a good thing.

Tether has a $30B+ market cap, which is a helluva lot of money. We'll find out how much of that is backed in May (or maybe earlier EoQ). Is r/buttcoin right, and crypto is funny money? Is r/bitcoin right that numbers only go up? Please argue a lot in the comments, thanks."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1916831|public|self|Bitfinex/Tether settlement with NY AG, and what happens on May 19th|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m6g2zg/bitfinextether_settlement_with_ny_ag_and_what/|all_ads|6|1615900266.0|EXCHANGE||EXCHANGE|||||||||||2021-03-16 18:41:06+00:00|t3_m6g2zg|0|16|0.86||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||16_03_21|03_21|0.12868376|0.4246554|0.44666085|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.1379556953907013|0.35149896144866943|0.01769876293838024|0.2853624224662781|0.1942172795534134|0.013266895897686481

CoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/labs-group

Basically their aim to bring blockchain technology to the real estate investing world. They plan on tokenizing property into NFTs with an ENJIN partnership, fractionalize investing (think crowd funding) with the use of cryptocurrency such as BTC and ETH, and offer leverage funding. 

I actually think there is even more room in this sector with the use of smart contracts for buying/selling, leasing, insurance, and repairs. 

I am also a real estate investor, so a project like this is definitely intriguing to me.
