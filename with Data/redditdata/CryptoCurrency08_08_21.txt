I read about Exit Strategy and I would like to know which is your personal exit strategy for Bull run for each coin taking account of Taxes.

In my case I have set when a coin do the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Currency|Holdings price x2|Holdings price 3x|Holding price 4x|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ETH|Sell 15%|Sell 20%|Sell 25%|

So, Let's get it done real quick. Last year on august, I stumbled upon term called ""Airdrop hunting"" and I started doing it I guess it was in August where 'Uniswap' did a airdrop campaign where each user would get (400) UNI tokens for using it at least once before September.

Guess what, I did $30 exchange and Just last week, I found out my ETH wallet was eligible for those UNI tokens. At the time of Airdrop these tokens were listed for $1200 in total but when I sold on Thursday with $25 each. I was able to get $10,000.

Now this crypto space really started to fascinate me. So, I had an digital agency and what I did was signed up for an Merchant account from Net-cents. After that, I merged my business journey with crypto.

I think everybody, at least once in their life, has had that tiny bit of FUD about whether or not they will even wake up in the morning. I think that's a healthy survival tactic, and we use it as a tool every day. Sometimes it bites you in the ass, and sometimes it saves your ass. For lack of a better way to summarize, nobody on this earth has any clue what they are doing.

Some people may have you fooled that they have it all together. They may play the part that makes you certain that they do, but the FUD for that scenario correctly lies in the fact that we are all just trying to figure this thing out. None of us have the answers, and none of us remember any past life to use as reference for what it's all about. This is important to understand, and I mean REALLY come to terms with. When you can see that, you'll find out that it's a liberating feeling.

I just spent the past couple hours reading old reddit and forum posts about some of our favorite top 100 coins, price predictions, TA, community acceptance, etc etc, and when prices were low for these brand new coins, people had a lot of negative things to say. It's important to note that all of these are still brand new. All of THIS is brand new, so no matter how certain even crypto as a whole may seem now, nothing has to happen, just like waking up in the morning. It was funny to read the FUD surrounding our top 100 coins when they were low caps, but it really opened my eyes to the fact even if this community is very knowledgeable, sometimes people are wrong... or sometimes they were right all along.

For all we know, our entire top 100 could be one big list of extremely long pump and dumps because it hasn't been all that long in the grand scheme of things. I obviously don't think that's true or I wouldn't be here, but obviously I could be wrong. When time has gone on and you're proven right about absolutely anything, it only feels so good because the FUD existed. This same observation applies to crypto, and I really think it would blow your mind if you've never read about some of your favorite ""sure thing"" investments being ridiculed as scams. Do your own research AND follow your gut. Right or wrong, all that truly matters is that you did the best you could to make sure your judgment was on par with who you are.

Anyway, just remember where Bitcoin started and how even people that are extremely interested in crypto today blew it all off back then. As always, time will tell. Invest as wisely as you can, and if you end up being wrong, then be proud of yourself for caring to put in real faith and effort. Remember, everyone looks like a genius in a bull market too. Things change, life is weird, and we're ALL human here. Humans do great things, and humans also make mistakes. Don't beat yourself up about it.

BUT.... we do know our beloved moons are a sure thing because... I mean, come on, obviously.

""I make more at my day job. Moons will never have an impact on my finances""

""It's for Filipinos that are living on the street. They are all begging for it like change""

 But take a look at the leaderboards. The top person got like 7,000 moons last month. When moons hit $1, that means he made $7,000 in a month. Do you first world guys really make that much money to where $7,000 is a negligible amount of money? You probably work 40 hours a week, 160 hours a month at a job you don't even like and you don't make that much money each month. (que the people in the comments claiming make $180k year in tech but don't know what a market cap is)

If you are a TechLead at Google then I underserstand (as a millionaire), but other than that... stop acting like moons are only for 3rd world citizens.

And so, naturally US government wants to collect taxes from the crypto.

However they seem to be going about it in a wrong way. It all currently about ""Reporting"" and KYC (know your customer data). 

\-It should rather be all about collecting taxes and nothing else.

Yes there are a lot of people that hide their greed for more and ever more untaxed gains under labels of ""development"". 

Well to them we can all say: guess what this is what governments do: they take a cut.

Taxing crypto however should be a lot more like sales tax on convenience store cash sales. And ideally government should collect it in crypto it's self.

There definitely should be a new government agency that regulates this whole new industry that snuck up on them. 

It should be started with younger people that know their way around computers and cell phones and yes, crypto.

There should be licensing requirement to operate in USA if you are running a defi protocol and it should be issued for the purpose of the enabling the defi protocol operator to collect ""sales tax"" and send it to the government. 

(Which can be automated and be run every day, ideally it should be sent to the government in crypto).

Honestly it all comes down to the idea of what is crypto is it money or securities? It is neither and it is both. It is new class of ""digital assets"" that has a bit of both, so to treat it as one class only would undermined the other side and vice versa.

US government can collect so much money by just taxing the crypto, but it has to be encouraged, grown, supported and THEN taxed. Not stifled by some arcane reporting regulations that are not possible to implement.

Two side notes.

Miners should be exempt from sales tax at the point of mining. They should be treated in a way people are treated when they grow potatoes in their back yard. However if you would like to go to a market and sell your potatoes it becomes a different situation and would have to be look at differently.

So basically if you grow some crypto in your ""farm"" and want to eat it, meaning buy some goods or services with it all you would pay is a sales tax, where it is applicable. If however you would like to sell the crypto and receive USD or EUR or what not that should be treated a separate business transaction.

Last point in a way of example to provide further proof that KYC reporting is completely extraneous and should not be done. 

If one in today’s world goes to a store and purchases anything with cash, there is not really any KYC reporting requirement to be met, just the need to enough cash. This obviously may vary with higher price tag items. But this is the idea that relates to the freedom and basic anonymity. If one goes into a store and buys a book, a microwave own a chair and uses cash as method of payment there is no thought of anyone asking them to fill out a form. This mechanic is as old as the world it's self and now crypto is slowly arriving to become more of a legal tender globally. 

US government would do good to consider how much of a legal tender crypto can become. That would be the normal, moving with the times situation."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3295121|public|self|US govenment wants to tax crypto?

I tried restoring an Exodus Desktop wallet to Atomic Desktop. It worked fine except the Bitcoin in the wallet did not register. Freaked me out, double checked everything, did it again and still no BTC. Triple checked everything, did it again, same result. 😳

I installed Exodus on another desktop and did the restore and the BTC showed up. Phew!! 

I thought that as long as the source and restore wallet accept the same number of seed words the restore will work. Clearly not the case.
