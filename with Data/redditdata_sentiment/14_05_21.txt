The pilot enters the room and says “Bad news, the plane is damaged too bad to fix. We have maybe 5 minutes before we’re going to have to abandon the plane.” Unfortunately, when they grab the parachutes, they see that one of them has an enormous rip through the middle and is unusable, which leaves three parachutes for the four of them.  
“I’m the pilot, so I get a parachute automatically!” says the pilot, and before anyone can argue, he grabs a parachute pack and jumps out of the plane.  
“I’m the worlds smartest man, and I need to keep moving technology forward, so I need to live too!” declares Elon Musk. He grabs a pack and jumps out of the plane.  
This leaves the mailman and the Dalai Lama. Before the mailman can say anything, the Dalai Lama says, “Don’t worry. I have lived a long life compared to you. I will go down with the plane.”  
“You don’t have to”, says the mailman. “The worlds smartest man just jumped out of a plane with my backpack.”

Please, don't fail for that rhetoric. Please, don't. This is not what mass adoption and decentralization look like. This is just a person, basically the second richest man in the world, the 1% of the 1%, playing with the money of millions of people. That's just the contrary of what decentralization truly is. One of the main goals of decentralization, as u/spitefire said in his [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nbyj5k/when_did_it_become_ok_in_peoples_eyes_to_allow/) is 
&gt; to get the financial system back into the hands of the ordinary person and not controlled and influenced by the top 1%. 

So, this is just the exact opposite of what cryptocurrencies stand for. 

Also mass adoption doesn't mean people buying shitcoins. Those are just people looking at a way to make easy money, they don't care about the projects or about the underlying technology behind those coins, or tokens, and that's why most shitcoins lack in fundamentals. 

Mass adoption means people will start using cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies because they have a huge amount of potential in changing our societies, in changing our economics and in changing our world. Using this technology means to democratize our financial system in order to reduce inequalities, in order to take back our privacy and in order to finally take back our money.

For me this technology is a gateway for a fairer world. So, this is not mass adoption and this is not decentralization, at all. This is the exact opposite.

am new to reddit for Crypto but have been trading now for several years in both this and stocks.

ShibaInu is a great coin. I still think this. I am heavily Invested in Shiba. I don't mind if the price drops, I'm set. But I'm looking out for you guys, those of you who are fomo'ing in to any project with your d\*cks in your hand or taking money that is not yours and putting it into things because now your up 20Gs and life is good...

...this isn't a game. I've seen many people in this last selloff affected negatively on pressures of famipy, friends and mainly emotions.

//Like I said, this isn't a game and emotions cannot be involved in making money -- Business//

Shiba's main interest to me is the high supply and the fact that we have an amazing community as its backbone. But, The promise of ShibaSwap being a competing exchange to trump all other DEXs is what caught my eye.

NGL, I was disappointed to see VB sell off 5% of his coins yesterday. No word, no mention, Ryoshi silent, etc.

(I follow everything thats been posted, but I don't think its good enough at least for the communitie's sake)

I understand that the community has lost trust now and I'm hoping there is some greater clarification besides 'don't worry, just wait a little longer'.

For me, just like with some on here, I believed in the decentralized aspect of this coin, and still do to a degree. The whitepaper makes it seem like VB had NO access to the shiba that he was given.

So If anything going forward, I'd love it if Ryoshi could help us by letting us know in detail about Shibaswap and how the audit is going. Again, not FUD, but the trust on the burn has put a bad taste in the communities mouth. If this is truly a community coin, we need transparency about small details such as ""Its a semi-burn"" as ryoshi mentioned (not a regular burn).

Even if VB burnt the tokens,which will make the price rise. The UTILITY of Shiba lies in ShibaSwap, without Shibaswap it IS just a meme token.So I'd still want to know updates about Shibaswap asap. If anything, that is the glue holding this community together. Without a DIRECT answer on the Audit process, its hard to say what direction Shiba will go in. As many promises have been broken so far and its main objective hasn't Completely been fulfilled (decentralization).

All in all, I like the publicity VB has given us, we are everywhere now. We have a few more pairs on binance now. We have the record breaking donation that will go down in history. 

Much good, so wow.

We are recovering which is nice, but BTC is being dragged thru the mud and taking many others down with it rn. This dip today has NOTHING to do with the VB dip from yesterday, I do believe that -50% dip from yesterday is all from VB. So if we have another -50% dip, it'll be solely be cuz BTC is tanking.

Again, I'm still in this. I'm fine and will hold through since I have cushion. I just want to give perspective, maybe some hope, some reality and let people know to do their own research and Know which generation you're apart of.

You can be a gen 3 and still be smart like a gen 2. The only real difference is that a Gen 2 investor has the experiences losing their money and the mistakes of the market. If you can avoid those same mistakes like us Gen 2s had to learn thru experience you'll be fine. But if you continue down the Gen 3 path, expect more of what you're feeling now (to the people who sold off at a loss) or put in money they CANT afford to lose. (You need not put in more that you CAN lose)

my last advice.

You either choose a path.

You're either a Trader or You're a Holder.

You can't be both.

It is sad that sustainability discussion arrives to the big picture after the most famous guy on the world tweets about that.

That said, better than nothing so please lets welcome this new focus, even if it is created from a hidden speculative intention.

Almost everyone who is after Elon Musk tweets is waiting for him to promote some cryptocurrency and buy it hoping for it to moon.

Like scavengers animals waiting for the crumbs left by the largest whales.

No, my meme coin is better, buy shiba/yeti/cat/duck...

Memecoins fanbases fighting each other.

Now, Elon tweets about looking for the greener choice...

And the best choices for sustainability are being eclipsed by bad projects with large fanbase shilling their own coin without having the actual knowledge on how their crypto works and why it is NOT suitable for a sustainable approach.

---

We shouldn't let this scavenger fight for profit affect the most promising crypto projects on the scene for sustainability.

Cryptocurrencies that rely on mining using lots of electricity are not sustainable as we all can see it.

Bitcoin can process 7 transactions per second. Which transactions those 7 are, is determined by the miner who basically chooses the highest fees Someone is willing to pay. Currently those are around 30$ I believe.

If someone would make 7 transactions every second to himself back and forth, and pays lets say about 500 or 1000$ per transactions, only his transactions get chosen by the miners. And nobody would be really willed to pay 1000$ for a Bitcoin transaction, and the network would die.

Now to if that’s realistic:
Lets take your all time favorite Elon, he makes around 300.000$ per minute (with stocks and all, I know he can’t just liquidate this easily). That’s 5k per minute and basically exactly the amount we would need. Also a government could just afford the money to DoS the network for quite a while. (Looking at China)


So in my eyes it would be totally doable for some big actors right? You could make transaction costs insanely high, and the network unusable. The only reason no one has done it yet is, cause it’s just not profitable

The name caught my attention due to the recent hype around Shiba Inu, and by investigating a bit deeper I found their project really interesting.

HNZO is an ERC20 token exchangeable through Uniswap, with similar characteristics to Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. However, unlike those, something I found super exciting is the so-called Automated Rewards Farming system (ARF). 

From what I understood, a small percentage of the transaction fees is evenly distributed to all holders of the coin, which means if you hold it in your wallet, you'll earn passive income quite constantly.

Also, unlike the other mentioned coins, HNZO's supply is limited. So even though the max amount of coins is still really high (100 trillion), it should be much more deflationary than Shiba and doge imo.

I purchased $66 worth of HNZO at around 0.0000002 per coin yesterday. The price has tripled as of right now, and I believe it could go much higher having in mind the coin's characteristics. 

Obviously, this is not investment advice, but I'd say it's worth checking it out. The project seems solid

We saw it from 2017/18 where some of these coins did not make it alive! You would be stuck holding the bag with some of them and for that reason you shouldn't have held in a single asset! 

I love to look at this web archive of coin market cap from 2017 as a comparison for where we stand today:

[https://web.archive.org/web/20170504003906/http://coinmarketcap.com:80/](https://web.archive.org/web/20170504003906/http://coinmarketcap.com:80/)

We have greater visibility now into which coins really stuck around and have grown significantly. Even now though, better coins might come out in the future that can overtake or replace your favorite coin. 

People love to say Bitcoin will always be king and who knows... that *might* be true. Or it *might* not.. 

Diversification is a great way to manage this risk.. we all love a good confirmation bias on our favorite coin, but be smart about your investments and diversify."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|2720301|public|self|Can't STRESS This Enough!

However, even so he kept bothering me every day to sell and buy back in to make more eth. I stuck to my guns and everyone including me told him to stop telling me what to do with my crypto or it would ruin our relationship. Fast forward to 4 in the morning last week, the morning after we signed our apt lease and he sold it all on me when it was at 3150 after harassing me for 20min straight and me telling him to shut the hell up and just do it and leave me alone. He KNEW not to though. Anyways, it never went back down to 3150 ever again and he made a series of poor trades trying to get it back resulting in me losing 1.25 eth. Should I continue to hold or trade to get back to my 6 eth? I don’t know what’s worth it anymore, I had my intentions to hold but now I just feel screwed and I’m not sure how to proceed.

I bought into Ethereum back in February and March when Eth was around 1500 and I was holding 6 of them, my boyfriend knew my intentions of holding it throughout the bull run and making no trades. However, even so he kept bothering me every day to sell and buy back in to make more eth. I stuck to my guns and everyone including me told him to stop telling me what to do with my crypto or it would ruin our relationship. Fast forward to 4 in the morning last week, the morning after we signed our apt lease and he sold it all on me when it was at 3150 after harassing me for 20min straight and me telling him to shut the hell up and just do it and leave me alone. He KNEW not to though. Anyways, it never went back down to 3150 ever again and he made a series of poor trades trying to get it back resulting in me losing 1.25 eth. Should I continue to hold or trade to get back to my 6 eth? I don’t know what’s worth it anymore, I had my intentions to hold but now I just feel screwed and I’m not sure how to proceed. I’m a novice and that’s exactly why I was planning on holding."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|2720110|public|self|Boyfriend sold and lost MY Ethereum on me; how do I get it all back?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ncgn6y/boyfriend_sold_and_lost_my_ethereum_on_me_how_do/|all_ads|6|1621000224.0|SUPPORT||SUPPORT|||||||||||2021-05-14 19:20:24+00:00|t3_ncgn6y|0|0|0.5||0||[]|True|False|[]||new||[]|||||||||||CHAT|||||||14_05_21|05_21|0.12868376|0.4246554|0.44666085|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.1379556953907013|0.35149896144866943|0.01769876293838024|0.2853624224662781|0.1942172795534134|0.013266895897686481

I’m a newbie and I apologise in advance if this is a stupid question. 

Looking at gaining an understanding around cross bridging smart chains and any need to have a central hub.

I’ve come across two projects that seem to land around this topic:

- ChainSwap
- POA Network

I get that we have an increasing number of smart chains and I’ve mainly used exchanges to swap between different products.

Unfortunately, I’ve not been able to understand how useful this utility might be for the crypto space. Was interesting in seeing what the community thinks and gain some education.

Would this utility provide any benefit that an exchange doesn’t already?"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|2719918|public|self|Are cross-chain bridging technologies a useful utility?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ncgfpj/are_crosschain_bridging_technologies_a_useful/|all_ads|6|1620999668.0|FOCUSED-DISCUSSION||FOCUSED-DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-05-14 19:11:08+00:00|t3_ncgfpj|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||14_05_21|05_21|0.13876511|0.43744275|0.4237922|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0502968467772007|0.11756440997123718|0.007791576907038689|0.5525232553482056|0.2615329921245575|0.010290921665728092

Never heard of this project before. It turns out they have been working on it for five years with a solid team. 

This week, I read an article about the five coins to replace bitcoin for Tesla. Now I was expecting the usual suspects, but read about the Chia Network for the first time. Created by the maker of bittorrent, based on harddrive mining. Sounds like a project to keep an eye on.

Now I am always a bit hesitant to hear about projects in a bull market, because most are complete BS. But I was very surprised that these two projects had completely passed me by all this time. While I try to keep up to date as good as I can about the news.

This made me think, are there more projects out there with low news coverage that are actually promising?

Anyway:

This is just a small point about the recent Musk saga that I have not seen mentioned anywhere. It might be irrelevant or not really important but still, might be worth to be kept in the back of our minds.

The tweet came only from Musk personal account. There is absolutely nothing on Tesla's official account about not accepting Bitcoin anymore. You would think it makes a lot more sense for it to be the other way around and Musk retweeting it. 

I am probably overthinking this, I often do, but what is someone way smarter than me finds something relevant about all this? The easy explanation is probably that at this point he does not see any difference between him and is multiple companies.

Again, could be unimportant but I thought it was worth noting.

On April 23 I transferred 1.5 billion Shiba Inu that I had bought while super cheap, back to my Hotbit account. Days later, Hotbit is hacked and shuts down for over a week. I can now finally log in but see zero balance. Etherscan shows my holdings in my wallet. I am now 8 replies deep with Hotbit. They keep asking what the problem is and are very vague in replies. It is very repetitive. $50k in holdings now equals 32k as of this evening. No phone number, poor support. It was never the goal to keep so many tokens there but they shut down on 4/30.
