One that could replace the use of government fiat currency. However, today there are not cryptocurrency that are realistically good enough to be used in place of standard USD debit cards or cash. So what properties would a cryptocurrency have to have in order for me to be able to stop using USD almost completely? I will attempt to build a list. The lack of any 1 of these properties would make it very, very difficult to replace USD completely. 

1. **Ownership/Control/Security** \- it must be in my control, like bitcoin. Not custodial, like PayPal. Many cryptos offer meet this requirement as it's perhaps the main benefit of crypto. 
2. **Cheap to use** \- I pay minimal transaction fees when using USD to buy things, I wouldn't want to switch to something that's much more expensive. 
3. **Easy to Use/Spend** \- Mobile wallets are important here, because I can't bring my PC and Hardware wallet to the grocery checkout. Must be comparable to Apply/Samsung pay
4. **Instant Settlement** \- I'll lump in Transaction times and TPS together here. If my transaction isn't final nearly instantly, I just can't to use it to replace USD at the checkout.  
5. **Financial Privacy** \- nobody knows the balance of my bank account or my transaction history when I use USD, and I wouldn't use a system where that info public. Nearly all coins fail this one.
6. **Stable value** (or increasing) - When using USD, I know how much purchasing power I have. If I have enough money in my account to pay my rent, then the next day I don't. That's a problem.

There are no cryptocurrencies in existence in existence today that have all of the required properties listed above, and that is why crypto is a competitor to fiat/USD today. 

At the risk of being downvoted for mentioning specific coins, I will provide some commentary on some existing projects that attempt to capture these important properties listed above. 

* **Bitcoin** \- Clearly provides property #1 (security) and I would also say it's fairly easy to use (Property #3) as there are many great mobile wallets that exist. Aside from properties, bitcoin fail to provide the rest listed, so its far from being a replacement for USD, at least for me. 
* **Smart Contract Coins** \- These, provide properties that go beyond that of traditional money and as such, is beyond the scope of this discussion. For the purposes of this discussion, Ethereum offers similar properties to that of Bitcoin, but the 12 sec transaction times (soon to be 2 sec) is a plus for property #4. The ability to use smart contracts to do Zcash-like transaction on Ethereum also adds a positive mark for property #5, although far from what Monero can provide.
* **Privacy Coins**
   * Monero - I would say that Monero offers the same properties as Bitcoin, #1 and #3 (I've found the mobile wallet *very* easy to use) but with the added benefit of privacy (#5).
   * Zcash - Similar properties to Monero, but with added negatives (in my opinion). The 20% dev tax and high inflation is an addition negative mark for #5 (stable value). The trusted setup could be seen as a negative mark for #1 (security), and the opt-in privacy is a negative for #5 (financial privacy). 
* **Stable Coins**
   * USDT, USDC, TUSD, etc. - These stable coins are among the few crypto projects that are able to provide property #6 (stable value). However, in doing essentially giving up property #1, as these coins are backed by a 3rd party company who olds the underlying assets. 
   * DAI - The stable coins stands out above the rest due to the fact that it is the only crypto project that can provide both properties #1 and #6. As a decentralized stable-coin, there is not 3rd party custodial. 
* **Instant transaction coins**
   * Nano - transactions are literally instant, so there is no waiting for confirmations. However, to achieve this the DPOS consensus algorithm is used, which can be seen as a negative mark against property #1 since most of the voting power is held by just a few accounts. Also worth noting transactions are *competely* free, although I don't think this is so important, since many coins have fees so low that they are practically free as well.
   * IOTA - Very similar properties to Nano in that transactions are free and instant. But again, like Nano, (#1) security is the tradeoff here, as IOTA still relies on a centralized coordinator, and even without it, the network is easier to attack than traditional PoW blockchains. Usability (#3) takes a hit here also, as you can't send IOTA to the same address twice, or it will be lost forever. 
   * Dash - Due to a recent update, Dash transactions are now 100% confirmed instantly. Dash also cannot be 51% attacked, so that's a positive mark for #1 (security). They also have (on the testnet now) human readable account names which is a plus for usability #3, although only slightly since QR codes are already easy to use. 

If I didn't list your favorite coin, or I am missing any projects with a unique combination of properties, please leave a comment and let me know. Obviously it's impossible for me to know everything about every project out there. 

As it stands today, there are no coins in existence that provides all 6 of these required properties, and that is the reason I still use USD for my day-to-day transactions. I could perhaps even look past 1 or even 2 of these properties if they were missing. But even then, few if any crypto projects today are close to providing all or most of these properties. 

In my estimation, the ideal USD replacement coin (for me) would look something like DAI + Monero's privacy + Nano's speed and feeless-ness.

# Motivation

Today, the worldâ€™s major technology platforms (Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Baidu, Facebook, WeChat, etc) are controlled by a relatively small group of people with relatively limited oversight. As a result, virtually all of our information is owned by people who may not have our best interests at heart, and the basic rules that govern virtually everything we do online get decided through opaque processes that we have very little transparency on and input into. Moreover, the owners of these platforms can exhibit an unprecedented amount of sway over our political process not only through traditional lobbying but also through their control over us as their users. Thus we are left with a situation in which what we say, what we see, what we hear, what we buy, and, if the trend continues, what we can and can't do with our lives, is ultimately out of our control, with little indication that things will change anytime soon. Is a world where a handful of platform oligarchs rule over us the kind of world we want to live in? Or could there perhaps be a better way to organize societyâ€™s technical infrastructure?

# Summary and Links

The Ultranet is the peoples' answer to the platform oligarchy.

* **Summary:** The Ultranet is first and foremost a decentralized private marketplace with a native cryptocurrency called Ultra (aka ""digital oil"") that can be purchased through a private decentralized exchange embedded in the Ultranet software. The Ultranet is designed such that each user who runs the software downloads and stores a cryptographically-secured copy of all of the listings, orders, ratings, and all other marketplace data through a novel concept we introduce called a ""block pool."" This means that as long as a single node somewhere in the world is running the Ultranet software, all data, including all listings and all reputation data, will be preserved. This is in stark contrast to virtually all platforms that exist today, which are subject to censorship of listings and/or outright take-down, the latter of which results in all reputation data being lost. Indeed, we are not aware of any marketplace that exists today, centralized or otherwise, that offers a comparable level of censorship-resistance and privacy (the Ultranet is pseudo-anonymous like Bitcoin), and the Ultranet achieves this while maintaining full feature parity and user experience parity with existing centralized marketplaces. The Ultranet also introduces Ultra, a hyper-deflationary cryptocurrency that is burned every time an order is placed on the system and by merchants in order to promote their listings, resulting in exponentially increasing scarcity over time (i.e. hyper-deflation). We refer to Ultra as ""digital oil"" because it is steadily burning away over time, unlike nearly all existing cryptocurrencies which do not actively burn or deflate over time (including Bitcoin and Ethereum).

# Features

Below are its main features:

* It offers a higher level of privacy and censorship-resistance than any marketplace platform that exists today.
   * It is fully decentralized and pseudo-anonymous like Bitcoin and everything is generally end-to-end encrypted.
   * As long as a single node somewhere in the world is running, all data, including all listings and reputation data, is preserved.
   * This is made possible through a new concept we introduce in the paper called a â€œblock pool.â€
* It comes packaged with a rich graphical user interface that provides a user experience that is on-par with existing non-decentralized, non-private alternatives (and that we think is superior in many ways).
* The software includes a built-in decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform, a built-in decentralized messaging platform, and a hyper-deflationary cryptocurrency called Ultra.
   * The decentralized exchange embedded in its software allows any user to seamlessly exchange Bitcoin for Ultra without involvement from any third parties, a feature made possible by a new concept we introduce in the paper called â€œinterchangeâ€ (Monero can also be used).
      * The complexity of the decentralized exchange mechanism is completely abstracted away from the user, making the experience feel identical to depositing and exchanging coins on a centralized exchange.
   * The messaging platform is end-to-end encrypted and fully-decentralized.
   * Ultra, the cryptocurrency native to the Ultranet platform, is hyper-deflationary in the long run (much more so than Bitcoin in fact), and can power a network effect to bootstrap usage of the platform.
      * We refer to Ultra as â€œdigital oilâ€ because, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, it is constantly â€œburningâ€ away over time through commissions as users make purchases, thus making it more and more scarce.
* These features are implemented on a new type of blockchain written entirely from-scratch in Go.
* In the paper we also present a proposal that uses the decentralized exchange concept to scale blockchains to thousands of transactions per second without compromising on decentralization or censorship-resistance.
* The Ultranet is completely open-source, which means that everything from the UI to how listings are ranked is collaboratively modifiable and upgradable. As such, through the power of global collaboration, the hope is that Ultranet can become the first ""Decentralized Platform Monopoly."""|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|963893|public|self|Introducing The Ultranet: The First Truly Decentralized Private Marketplace, The First Hyper-Deflationary Cryptocurrency (Digital Oil), The First Decentralized Platform Monopoly|0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/eybboz/introducing_the_ultranet_the_first_truly/|all_ads|6|1580734388.0|||||||||||||2020-02-03 18:23:08+00:00|t3_eybboz|0|43|0.88||

As a student and part time worker for 14/ hour. Also not really smart about trading crypto as well. Mostly just because i want to try it out. Just recently find out that we need to pay tax on the crypto.

First of all I barely remember anything about it. In 2017 i do have some gained if I not wrong it would below 10k $ in cash out usd value. Then in  2018 i put back in crypto like 7k usd and lost it all to pump and dump scam or just cant stand when the money is bleeding so i cash out what ever i had left... would be 3k$ some like that.

Then in 2019 i dont know why im step back in crypto, i did bought some coin on coinbase and also starting using coinbase pro and day trading like mad person. I ended up transfer to Binance exchange and still store my coin over there. I still can remember in this year i put in crypto in total like 6k usd. I did transfer back to coinbase for cash 2k usd and using that 2k put back again to binance. 

Nobody tell me about crypto tax at all until i read some articles and find out that could be result in bad situation . What should i do? It gonna be mad or even impossible to track everything. I dont mind to pay if i have to pay tax on what ever i gained but I dont know where to start and how ??? Please any advice?"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|963787|public|self|Crypto tax!!!

BITMEX is currently the largest  Bitcoin derivative exchange, where futures for major cryptocurrencies  are traded, instruments used by major investors and miners to speculate  and protect their capital. Through futures, the investor can assume  short positions, which increases his trading possibilities, use leverage  and diversify his positions in a strategic way.

Trading  bots are widely used in the financial markets, and especially in the  crypto market. Any trader knows how important it is to have emotional  control to succeed in business, and also that a volatile asset like  Bitcoin, stress and lack of sleep can impair performance ... sleepless  nights, constant anxiety and lack of time for leisure and family, can  bring harm to health!

Range  (XBTUSD) is a mathematical model developed using quantitative analysis  techniques to operate Bitcoin futures. It calculates the fair price of  the currency and opens long / short positions when the price deviates  from the average, allowing the investor to make transactions when the  price is in consolidation process, a condition found most of the time.

 Trend (XBTUSD) is a mathematical model developed using quantitative  analysis techniques to operate Bitcoin futures. It was designed to act  when the price of the currency is in trend, regardless of the direction,  being able to profit during rallies or in moments of meltdown.

 Hedge (XBTUSD) is a mathematical model developed using quantitative  analysis techniques to protect capital through short positions in  Bitcoin futures. These are “lock” operations (opening a selling position  without leverage), used to protect the Bitcoin price from major falls,  allowing the investor to accumulate more bitcoins when the price is  falling. It is a type of minimally speculative operation, aimed at  long-term investors who want to keep their Bitcoin wallet safe.

Portfolio is a set of strategies  designed to operate the XBTUSD and ETHUSD futures. This product is based  on the Modern Portfolio Theory developed by Harry Markowitz, which is  based on the reduction of risk through the diversification of assets.  This is a quantitative analysis technique generally used by investors in  the stock market in order to optimize a portfolio of assets with low  correlation with each other, thus allowing to form a portfolio that  maximizes the return for a given level of risk. To replicate this  technique in the crypto market, 4 strategies are used in Bitcoin and  Ethereum futures. The customer can choose to use up to 3 accounts or run  all trading bots on the same account.

You don’t need to have costs with  platforms, hiring VPS or keeping your computer on, as the bot runs in  the cloud and sends orders automatically to your account at BITMEX, 24  hours a day and 7 days a week. You only need to create a key to access  your account that will allow orders to be sent. Your Bitcoins remain  entirely in your custody, without passing through the hands of third  parties.

This is not only a  product, but also a service that is constantly being optimized. The  amount charged is for the monthly subscription and after the end of the  period the customer receives a report with details of all operations.

Their goal for this place isn't to host ""open discussions on all subjects related to emerging crypto-currencies or crypto-assets"", unlike what the sidebar says. Their goal is to ensure Bitcoin maximalism remain the dominant mentality here.

Let's recap, since 2017, we've had...

* A strict rule of 2 articles per project, that specifically does not apply to Bitcoin
* Multiple pointless flair in the hopes of confusing users, preventing ""powerusers"" from becoming too recognizable and influential (many users who were supporters of projects they don't like were manually ""downgraded"" from ranks like gold/platinum to silver despite more than meeting requirements for the higher ranks)
* Constant suppression of positive coverage articles of unwanted projects despite no rules broken
