[EXPERIMENT - Tracking Top 10 Cryptos of 2020 - Month 7 +71&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/bor9du3sxrg51.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=126a4ad5bb0480707d74b8de827305745c1e3346)

***See the full blog post with all the nerdy tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-7/)***. If you're just joining us, this probably isn't what you think it is: it's more of a documentary than investing advice. See the rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***

tl;dr: As of the end of July, the 2020 Top Ten Cryptos were up +71%.  **ETH** best performer in July followed by **XRP** and **BSV**. Overall since Jan 2020:  **ETH** moves into first place, followed by **BSV**. 100% of 2020 Top Ten are in positive territory, all ahead of **Tether.**

Over three years, July 2020 is the first month that the combined crypto Top Ten Portfolios have outperformed a hypothetical same approach with the S&amp;P.  Details:

## Month Seven – UP 71%

https://preview.redd.it/iiyifztdzrg51.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fc7a653bd058f4664ad6443b590e368c58167fc

[Last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-6/), I warned the 2020 Top Ten to watch its back. After being ahead most of the year, the 2020 Top Ten has officially lost its status as the best performing of the [Top Ten “Index Fund” Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). Up +71% as of July, the 2019 Top Ten is now second to the [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-19/), which is up…. +72%.

## Question of the month:

#### Which cryptocurrency surged in value after a TikTok challenge that encouraged users to buy went viral?

A) Dogecoin  
B) Chainlink  
C) Bitcoin  
D) Ethereum

*Scroll down for the answer.*

## Ranking and June Winners and Losers

[2020 Top Ten Rank](https://preview.redd.it/s2v3tsilzrg51.png?width=412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b95ff4b1df9a8bef390fcd0b17372ea6fa063db7)

Another month of mostly downward movement: the “T”s (**Tether** and **Tezos**) both fell one spot. **BNB** dropped two spots and now is at the very edge of the Top Ten. **XRP** climbed one in the rankings, taking back third place from **Tether**. Regardless of how you feel about **XRP**, it was a bad sign to many crypto observers to find a stablcoin in the Top Three [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-6/) (no offense meant, **USDT**).

***July Winners*** – **ETH,** up a massive +55% in July. **XRP** and **BSV** tied for second place, both up +52% on the month.

***July Losers*** – **Tether.** The second worst performing crypto, **Tezos**, finished the month up +19%.

Since COVID has hammered the sporting world, let’s be overly competitive and pit these cryptos against themselves, shall we? Here’s a table showing which cryptos have the most monthly wins and losses at this point in the experiment. In a three way tie for first place we have **ETH,** **Tether,** and **Tezos**, each with two Ws. **BSV** and **Tether** have the most Ls – both have finished in last place three out of the first seven months of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

## Overall update – ETH moves into first place, followed by BSV. 100% of Top Ten are in positive territory.

**Ethereum** has moved into a commanding lead, up +177% on the year, followed by **BSV**, up +141%. After three straight months in the lead, **Tezos** fell hard in July, now sitting in third place (although still up an impressive +124% in 2020). Discounting **Tether** (again, no offense Big-T), **EOS** (+27%) is the worst performing cryptocurrency of the 2020 Top Ten portfolio. 100% of the cryptos in this group are either flat or in positive territory.

## Total Market Cap for the cryptocurrency sector:

The overall crypto market gained more than $80B in July, and is now up over +80% since the beginning of this year’s experiment in [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/).

## Bitcoin dominance:

[BitDom](https://preview.redd.it/5eunxhjg1sg51.png?width=415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dbd08fe8fb7f24a87bf72138db587e7761b6762)

**BitDom** finally budged: it fell about 2.5% percent to land at 62.3%, signaling a greater appetite for altcoins this month. The range up to this point in the year has been roughly 62% to 68%.

## Overall return on investment since January 1st, 2020:

After an initial $1000 investment, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio is now worth $1,713, up +71%. It is no longer the best performing of [the three](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/) Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolios, but isn’t too far behind: the 2019 group came in at +72% in [July](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-18/).

Here’s the month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, hopefully helpful to maintain perspective and provide an overview as we go along:

[ROI, month by month](https://preview.redd.it/dn8gmv7n3sg51.png?width=380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09e985463da6cabb7cda12866b84a107bb689317)

Besides the [zombie apocalypse blip](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/) in March, so far so good: all green is good to see and a nice change from the [all red table](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-31) you’ll see in the 2018 experiment. The range of monthly ROI for the 2020 Top Ten has been between +7% in March and +71% in July.

So, how does the 2020 Top Ten Experiment compare to the parallel projects?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-31): down -74% (total value $260)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-19): up +72% (total value $1,722)

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $3000 investment in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, my combined portfolios are worth $3,695‬** ($260+ $1,722 +$1,713).

**That’s up about +23%** for the three combined portfolios, compared to -10% [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-6). It also marks the highest ROI of the three combined portfolios since I started keeping track in January 2020. The previous high was +13% back in [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/).

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a new table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

[Combined $3k ROI](https://preview.redd.it/yqun3ntt3sg51.png?width=445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4921ba3fcc16e1d502ea6541b18aa0b6d97da39)

That’s a +23% gain by buying $1k of the cryptos that happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st, 2018, 2019, and 2020.

But what if I’d gone all in on only one Top Ten crypto for the past three years? While most have come and gone over the life of the experiment, five cryptos have remained in Top Ten for all three years: **BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,** and **LTC.**  Let’s take a look at those five:

&amp;#x200B;

[ETH then BTC well in front](https://preview.redd.it/htfgm5298sg51.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=726a4a623c80f5c29f18871825a7c170ccb38d58)

There you have it: **Ethereum** (+98%) would have returned the most at this point, followed closely by **BTC** (+88%). Following this approach with **XRP,** I would have been down -23%. Many thanks to Reddit user u/sebikun for the idea for a new metric.

So that’s the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments snapshot. Let’s take a look at how traditional markets are doing.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. Even with no end to the COVID pandemic in sight, the S&amp;P continued its recovery. In July it moved into positive territory for the year.

[S&amp;P breaks even](https://preview.redd.it/fqh5l5d18sg51.png?width=346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcde1e0205da9f1361d6dcf3508d4d894b288325)

Over the same time period, the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning about +71%. The initial $1k investment in crypto is now worth about $1,713.

The money I put into crypto in January 2020 would be worth $1010 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500. That’s a $703 difference on a $1k investment, the largest gap in favor of crypto all year.

But that’s just 2020. What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first three years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method? Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018: +$220
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019: +$310
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020: +$10

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After three $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, and 2020, my portfolio would be worth $3,540.**

That **$3,540** is up over **+18%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/), compared to a **+23%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios over the same period of time.

Do you know what that means? That means we have a first this month: a 5% swing ***in favor of the*** [***Top Ten Crypto Portfolios***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/)!

As you’ll see in the table below, this is the first time since I started recording this metric that crypto has outperformed a hypothetical identical investment in the S&amp;P. This is a big turnaround from the 22% difference in favor of the S&amp;P just [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-6).

[Crypto takes the lead](https://preview.redd.it/zm91olug8sg51.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8df18340bee07ab27146cfa0511f119119ab82e)

## Implications/Observations:

The crypto market as a whole is up +81% since the beginning of the year compared to the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio which has gained +71%. For the third month in a row, focusing on the Top Ten cryptos has yielded less than the overall market.

This approach has seen mixed results with the 2020 group. For the first four months, the Top Ten outperformed the market as a whole. This was a bit of a surprise, as this strategy did not work out very well in the other experiment years. Although there are a few examples of the Top Ten strategy outperforming the overall market in the [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-19), it’s interesting to note at no point in the first thirty-one months of the [Top Ten 2018 Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-31) has the approach of focusing on the Top Ten cryptos outperformed the overall market. Not even once.

## Conclusion:

July was undoubtedly a strong month in crypto. Where do we go from here? Do we consolidate for a time, fall back down, or continue the ascent? Will **Bitcoin** dominance continue to decline as altcoins receive more attention?

Final word: Please take care of yourselves and your neighbors. FYI – [everyone is your neighbor](https://youtu.be/bWrbQRZobFg?t=32).

Thanks for reading and for supporting the experiment. I hope you’ve found it helpful. I continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports. Keep an eye out for the original [2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-30) and the [2019 Top Ten Experiment ](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-18)follow up experiment.

## And the Answer is…

A) Dogecoin

Much wow. A [TikTok viral challenge](https://fortune.com/2020/07/09/tiktok-dogecoin-challenge/) drove up the price of Doge nearly 100% in early

I received an email confirmation that $2,468 was successfully invested with $32 being taken for fees. All seems normal to this point.

While looking at the Chainlink menu/page under ""history"" I noticed that only $2,247 was applied to link, and that the difference between $2,468 and $2,247 ($221) was missing. My balance also reflects this. Its like salt in the wound that the price went up even further meaning i missed out on $221 plus the gains.

I opened an issue with Coinbase and their reply was that they take the fee and an additional 200 ""basis points of spread"" (I don't know what points are) to account for volatility.

This means that their effective fee is over 10%?? I know the transaction was not processed manually due to Coinbase volume. Does Coinbase really apply a fee and then sneak a skim off the top? Why are my confirmation email and account showing significantly different values? Now I have to check each transaction to make sure the confirmation emails actually match my account. Terrible look for Coinbase and if they do not rectify this by comping me $221 plus gains, then I am certainly leaving their platform and suggesting everyone does as well.

I would love a Coinbase rep to explain this to me."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1073612|public|self|Coinbase is skimming more than their fee off the top?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/i94g0u/coinbase_is_skimming_more_than_their_fee_off_the/|all_ads|6|1597320643.0|EXCHANGE||EXCHANGE|||||||||||2020-08-13 17:40:43+00:00|t3_i94g0u|0|52|0.93||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||13_08_20|08_20|0.11076456|0.4499968|0.43923864|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07071885466575623|0.20293867588043213|0.01466779038310051|0.2337827980518341|0.4597536027431488|0.018138350918889046

[**WARNING**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=flair_name%3A%22WARNING%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)

I'm a developer and I looked over the Chainlink white paper and documentation, as well as many blog posts. Here are a few reasons I would not use Chainlink for my own apps:

1. The current ""mainnet"" is not decentralized. there's no way to decentrally assess if an oracle is any good or not.
2. It took them 2 years to basically build centralized oracles, which is extremely unimpressive (and already exists). I do not have much hope for the future or the competency of their engineers.
3. The white paper doesn't coherently describe how they plan on making their centralized design decentralized one day. They broadly go over their ""decentralized"" reputation strategies as if creating sybil resistant decentralized reputation is something of an afterthought when it's actually an unsolved computer science problem. They've had 3-4 years and 30mil in funding to actually publish technical specifications for this and instead they decided to build trivial centralized oracles. Extremely worrying. It kind of reminds me of IOTA ""we'll remove the coordinator later"". No, you won't. You don't know-how.
4. News outlets and journalists keep reporting on ""partnerships"" with Google and Swift. But if you actually read the source for the ""partnership"", it's just a blog post by Google Cloud that promotes their own service (BigQuery) and shows an example about how Chainlink users can use Google Cloud if they want. In no way is Google partnered or planning on using Chainlink themselves. The Chainlink codebase is extremely trivial to rebuild if Google wanted to get into the blockchain oracle space.

While there are certainly profits to be made by trading Chainlink, I recommend you do not HODL it with the hope that one day developers will adopt it as their source for decentralized oracles. That certainly won't happen."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1073139|public|self|Do Not Hold Chainlink Long-Term|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/i8r7sw/do_not_hold_chainlink_longterm/|all_ads|6|1597264218.0|TRADING||TRADING|||||||||||2020-08-13 02:00:18+00:00|t3_i8r7sw|0|18|0.52||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||13_08_20|08_20|0.06340579|0.49510497|0.44148928|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.08904828876256943|0.15009088814258575|0.0093326261267066|0.4671396017074585|0.2762399911880493|0.008148635737597942

London, UK, July 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (via [Blockchain Wire](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=helmJPV6Huldv6mz4vYg__-A9cmZgmqM0ZwFQWed62RhhIKgtUxLawXNznHxh_hSe99JeiefNxltjOEqaGCnYQ==)) Quant network, one of the world’s leading pioneers in enterprise blockchain technology, has announced the appointment of Neil Smit, Vice Chairman of Comcast Corporation, to its Board of Directors with immediate effect. The appointment is a key element in Quant’s strategy of expansion and growth.

To support this expansion in the US, Quant has appointed Neil Smit, Vice Chairman of Comcast Corporation, to its Board of Directors.

“I’m both delighted and honored to become part of the Quant team,” said Neil Smit. “The company is a clear leader in one of the most exciting field of technology right now, and the potential for growth is enormous. I’m excited to be in a position to help realize that growth.”

Gilbert Verdian, CEO, Quant Network commented: “Building our presence in the US is critical to our business strategy, and Neil has the perfect background and experience in large-scale Internet networks to help achieve our vision. We’re delighted that he has accepted a position on our Board.”

&amp;#x200B;

A little background about myself:

First, let me put this out there. I am no one special. I am not different than anyone here. I'll keep it short. I've been around crypto for a while. I do not day trade. I buy when the market hits the floor, and come back and sell when things start to look suspiciously bullish. It's easier said than done. I know. But honestly, I'm sure many of you can relate. Regardless of fundamentals, when you start to see a certain type of behavior in the market, you get this little spidey sense telling you something. So here is mine.

&amp;#x200B;

2020 Bull Event:

Many of you have been noticing the crypto market in an uptrend. Especially with the not-so-new buzz word DeFi (stands for Decentralized Finance). So we are currently witnessing some impressive uptrend price movement with Chainlink ($LINK), and its bullish cycle has started an exo-affect on other coins in the DeFi market. (I'm going to use the word ""exo-affect"" to describe domino affects of post-price movements).

&amp;#x200B;

Now we are noticing other coins such as Maker ($MKR), Compound ($COMP), and Aave ($LEND). Earlier I said I am going to disregard fundamentals slightly. I'll tell you why. Fundamentals are great, and I use them all the time. But with the current market behavior, it is crucial to use psychological market behavior since FOMO is kicking in with only the DeFi related cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you notice about the recent three that started pumping? Two out of three of the cryptocurrencies literally have two buzz words related to decentralized finance, such as compound and lend. Maker is known, so the crowd knows it already. Easy to distinguish, and the people are just jumping on them. You have sites like coinmarketcap and coingecko making pages dedicated to DeFi to help you narrow it down.

&amp;#x200B;

So is it done? Did you miss the bandwagon?

Honestly, no one knows, and I certainly do not know. But Considering some of the coins hitting ATH, and Chainlink has been on a bullish run for a while. I would say there are more opportunities still. If you stick to the psychological behaviors, I feel the price will play a factor. As stupid as this sounds, people will see low prices as ""cheap prices"", and think it is an opportunity. I know that is entirely dumb, but we saw it happen in the 2017/2018 bull run.

&amp;#x200B;

So which DeFi coins people have not noticed yet?

There are honestly several coins that might start pumping when considering the psychological behaviors I mentioned above. FOMOers might see attraction in coins such Terra ($LUNA), Request ($REQ), and 0x ($ZRX). These are just some that fit the ""low-price"" psychological criteria and haven't reached highs like the others.

&amp;#x200B;

But once the FOMOers start noticing, most of have been pumped or people that made money on previous pumps. They will start jumping into the ones that are priced higher such as Augur ($REP).

&amp;#x200B;

I am not going to go through all of them. Just check out coingecko or coinmarkets section for DeFi and go through the list.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I know it all sounds dumb. But when the market is irrational, who do you think it making those irrational decisions?

&amp;#x200B;

When you look at things like Ethereum, it started its gradual momentum in an uptrend. Why isn't it pumping hard like the rest? It is more liquid and holds a higher market share than the rest. Those Defi coins are pumping hard because their books are illiquid. But once the stages I mentioned above are complete, trading will flow into Ethereum, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. So the rest will have its moment after.  If everything starts flowing like the way I mention in this post, then I might make another post for the next phase of the bubble.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't take anything I am saying here seriously, and make sure you do your own damn research before making any investment decisions!"|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|224777|public|self|What you need to know (PART #1: FOMO Psychology) - Bull Run 2020: Exo-Affects|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/i8s42f/what_you_need_to_know_part_1_fomo_psychology_bull/|all_ads|6|1597267778.0|sentiment||Sentiment|||||||||||2020-08-13 02:59:38+00:00|t3_i8s42f|0|14|0.78||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||13_08_20|08_20|0.09943512|0.50272423|0.39784065|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0823168158531189|0.11424129456281662|0.01224549487233162|0.49923110008239746|0.2819773554801941|0.009987949393689632

I am considering investing all money i would normally put into stocks into crypto moving forward. I am doing this for long term investment &amp; retirement, so again not looking for get rich quick at all as it would be small amounts (£100 here £100 there). Because of this, I am strongly leaning toward investing in straight Bitcoin &amp; Eth as they are established and not going anywhere. I am interested though before I start investing, what are some great crypto's that also pay dividends and are lookingg good long term?

Even though from the very beginning developers asked to pay attention to the fact that the code was not audited and was created ‘just for fun’, its price reached $167. Soon after it was launched, a bug was discovered. A huge amount of new tokens was created due to the mechanism that was supposed to balance the price of the token.
