It’s no secret that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. This and a number of other characteristics make it an unusually effective candidate for tax loss harvesting strategies. This guide outlines what tax loss harvesting is, how you can use it to reduce your bitcoin and crypto tax liability.

Tax Loss Harvesting - What Is It?

Tax Loss Harvesting is the practice of selling a capital asset at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability. By realizing or “harvesting” a loss, investors are able to offset taxes on both gains and income. This is a tax reduction strategy commonly used in the world of stocks and securities. 

An Example

John buys $1,000 of Apple stock and $2,000 of Tesla stock in a given year. While holding these investments, the value of John’s Apple stock rises to $1,500 while Tesla drops to $1,700. John sells all of his Apple stock for $1,500.

Without Tax Loss Harvesting

Without harvesting his losses in Tesla stock, John has a $500 capital gain for the year from the sale of his Apple stock. John pays taxes on all $500 of this capital gain.

With Tax Loss Harvesting

Rather than continuing to hold his Tesla stock, John can harvest his losses in Tesla by selling before year-end. Capital gains and losses get summed together for the year resulting in either a net gain or loss. John’s net capital gain is now only $200 for the year ($500 - $300). In this scenario, John only pays taxes on $200 of net capital gains rather than $500.

Tax Loss Harvesting With Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are treated as property for tax purposes, exactly the same as stocks. This means that you can also strategically sell/trade crypto to harvest losses and reduce your tax liability. Unlike stocks however, cryptocurrencies have unique characteristics that make them even better candidates for tax loss harvesting. We discuss these below. 

Wash Sale Rules

A wash sale results when you incur a capital loss, and then buy the same security back within a 30-day window before or after the capital loss is incurred. This rule is designed to prevent investors from taking capital losses in one year and then immediately buying back the stock. The [**IRS specifically states**](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2016_publink100010601) that wash sale rules only apply to securities. Cryptocurrencies are property, not securities, as defined by [**IRS guidance**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf). This means that wash sales rules do not apply to cryptocurrency at this time.

Volatility

Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile—more so than traditional assets. This volatility means that investors regularly have opportunities to realize and harvest capital losses. The difficult part for investors is identifying which of their cryptocurrencies in their portfolio have the highest **cost basis** (original purchase price) when compared to the current market price. These are the assets that present the greatest opportunity for tax savings. [**CryptoTrader.Tax**](https://www.cryptotrader.tax/) has a tax loss harvesting tool built into the app that allows users to automatically identify which of their cryptocurrencies present the greatest loss harvesting opportunity.

An Example

Amy has made $15,000 in capital gains from investing in the stock market this year. Amy has also been investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum. In December, Amy imports her cryptocurrency transactions into CryptoTrader.Tax and notices that her investments are down over $20,000 for the year. To harvest these losses, Amy trades all of her cryptocurrencies into Litecoin (thus incurring a [**taxable event**](https://www.cryptotrader.tax/blog/when-do-you-owe-taxes-on-your-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency) and realizing her losses). Amy’s losses in cryptocurrency complete offset all of her stock market gains, and she’s left with a $5,000 capital loss for the year.

Net Capital Losses Up to $3,000 Offset Ordinary Income

Whenever total capital gains and losses for the year add up to a negative number, a net capital loss is incurred. If the net capital loss is less than or equal to $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and filing a separate tax return), then that entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income—like the income from your job. Net losses exceeding $3,000 are rolled forward to subsequent years.  

December 31st is the Cutoff - Time is of The Essence!

It is important to keep in mind that the tax year ends on Dec. 31st—even though the filing deadline isn’t until April 15th. This means that you must harvest your losses prior to the end of the year if you want them to impact that year’s taxes. Many investors delay only to realize that they could have saved money on their tax bill if they would have sold or realized losses back in December. By then it’s too late."|False|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|950630|public|self|Guide on crypto tax loss harvesting|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ec4qc7/guide_on_crypto_tax_loss_harvesting/|all_ads|6|1576609021.0|FINANCE|709d50a8-1deb-11e4-9b08-12313b0b24aa|FINANCE|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Z0vCaRRRkt9ylnWgnNSn34e8uk71i5mwVPnFBV3BS5E', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/5U3qhoAPo5FLzwAbOeflFDyeDgvZA3tP8Eocc17woWo.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd4702cda0bf69c439edb76d392e4a34ecc2cb0c', 'width': 108}], 'source': {'height': 200, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/5U3qhoAPo5FLzwAbOeflFDyeDgvZA3tP8Eocc17woWo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=982ed28bc82aae77d64ea0a1adeab041693896eb', 'width': 200}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||2019-12-18 00:27:01+00:00|t3_ec4qc7|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]|[]|||||||||||||||||||||18_12_19|12_19|0.09889186|0.4752179|0.42589024|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.09181936085224152|0.2768768072128296|0.01671096496284008|0.2734857499599457|0.32773882150650024|0.01336834579706192

The crowdfund smart contract has been written in such a way, that it should ensure delivery of the product - or at least protect you from no delivery by getting your entire contribution back. (see below)

The intended audience is mainly power-users, and by that I mean, people who know how to program (in Python), know their way in linux, bash and on the commandline... Or Raspberry pi makers. That being said, it should work for beginners as well, but expect at some point that you will probably have to get technical (It's intended to be run on a Raspberry pi 3 b, so sooner or later, you will at least need to update the device.). 

If you don't want to get your feet wet, don't buy it.

A lot of wallets and portfolio apps have been made, which is great, but I wanted something simple, and portable, - and not on a phone - where I had 100% control, so I wrote it in Python 3 (as I have been doing a lot of development in Python over the last few years). There's a lot of multicoinwallets out there now who somehow claim to be open source, but whose source is nowhere to be found. They USE opensource libraries, but the end product is closed. This will be COMPLETELY open sourced if crowdfund targets are met. It's not a wallet btw, it only tracks price.

The idea is very simple. You keep your entire portfolio as a csv file, and every time you adjust your portfolio, you add a line to the csv with the current date. This way you can easily build a version history of your portfolio.

I'm looking for people who like to play around with the code, optimize it for their own needs (and preferably contribute the enhancements back to the community.)

So expect the basics in UI-friendliness. (the web app is built with Flask and Vue). Check the website for a link to a Youtube screencast that demonstrates the app.

If you want to plugin data science tools, if you want to experiment with automating your portfolio at scale, and track your performance with a lot of data, this is the portfolio software for you.

(For example I included some scripts that auto update Livepeer balances from staking wallets.)

Apart from the portfolio software (which is not tied to the device btw, it works on any OS with Python installed), this is also a simple display, that shows you the rate of your top 10 coins. (the gadget...)

It probably looks like a ridiculous gadget, and to be honest, I don't mind at all, hence the website name [rocketclock.club](https://rocketclock.club), referring to the rocket meme. 

But in all fairness, I've been working on and off on this project for the last 2 years, but the first prototype has been on my desk for almost 2 years, and it has one very cool feature, that in my view, is priceless. 

It kept me calm. Holy crap, has this thing kept me calm throughout the bear market. No endless refreshing on Coinmarketcap, or my phone. Just this tiny device on my desk, with the e-ink refresh every 5 minutes. It's what has enabled me to focus on my work, on developing, and not be distracted by the market all the time. You would maybe think the opposite should've been true, but this has been my experience.

The e-ink display is also written in Python, so it could be easily adjusted if you want to include custom data. (Maybe you would like to replace the rocket with another emoticon or meme, that would be pretty easy).  
Market data is pulled from Coingecko, so please beware that its functionality depends for a large amount on this website. All that being said, I haven't experienced much downtime since I started using Coingecko.

(by sending you agree to the terms and conditions on the website)

&amp;#x200B;

(the price is 0.15 ETH and 0.10 ETH acts as collateral, which gets returned when you claim your download)

&amp;#x200B;

If the download is not delivered on time, you can withdraw your entire ETH contribution (price + collateral) as you can read in the smart contract.

(Please read the contract to understand how this works. The original smart contract was reprogrammed because somebody on the Bitcoin talk forum asked how I would guarantee the delivery of the download. The token you receive acts as a vote of approval. So here it is: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x96f0b742daa1216961f4caf846fea5af60733aeb#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0x96f0b742daa1216961f4caf846fea5af60733aeb#code))

&amp;#x200B;

The risk here is actually almost entirely on my side; talking about an industry's first ;)  
(unless I'm overlooking a bug in the contract, which I hope is not the case - I've tested it for weeks locally and on Ropsten testnet. So please, again; read the smart contract!)

There are also places you can get paid in Cryptocurrency for completing surveys or doing small tasks.\n\nAs with anything on the internet you use these at your own risk and do be careful out there in faucet land.

These are referral links so I might get some fantastic referrals like you in exchange for creating this hopefully useful list. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing you will need is patience, if you are going to try to get some bitcoins or altcoins for free.  it&amp;#39;s not really free basically you are being given a very tiny amount of crypto-currency for watching internet advertising or for competing in games or challenges.  There are also places you can get paid in Cryptocurrency for completing surveys or doing small tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As with anything on the internet you use these at your own risk and do be careful out there in faucet land.

So, I invented my own blockchain.  And it is fully centralized.

I view technology through the lens of practical application.  My area of interest was use cases related to transactional control.  My starting point was, therefore, not to define what blockchain can do, but what cannot be done with current technology and system architecture.  That would answer what I would functionally expect from an, as yet, unnamed technology model.  

So, what cannot be done with conventional information technology models and practices?

The following cannot be done with conventional technology.

	• User centric authority

	• Universal and immutable truth

	• Authoritative decoupling and authoritative portability

The first two points above can (sort of) be done with existing blockchain models but point three cannot be done with existing public or private blockchain.

I will elaborate upon these points in a subsequent discussion.  We are [TrxaaS.com](https://TrxaaS.com) as in (Transaction as a Service).  We are a very early stage startup.  [TrxaaS.com](https://www.trxaas.com)

It’s no secret that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. This and a number of other characteristics make it an unusually effective candidate for tax loss harvesting strategies. This guide outlines what tax loss harvesting is, how you can use it to reduce your bitcoin and crypto tax liability.

Tax Loss Harvesting - What Is It?

Tax Loss Harvesting is the practice of selling a capital asset at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability. By realizing or “harvesting” a loss, investors are able to offset taxes on both gains and income. This is a tax reduction strategy commonly used in the world of stocks and securities. 

An Example

John buys $1,000 of Apple stock and $2,000 of Tesla stock in a given year. While holding these investments, the value of John’s Apple stock rises to $1,500 while Tesla drops to $1,700. John sells all of his Apple stock for $1,500.

Without Tax Loss Harvesting

Without harvesting his losses in Tesla stock, John has a $500 capital gain for the year from the sale of his Apple stock. John pays taxes on all $500 of this capital gain.

With Tax Loss Harvesting

Rather than continuing to hold his Tesla stock, John can harvest his losses in Tesla by selling before year-end. Capital gains and losses get summed together for the year resulting in either a net gain or loss. John’s net capital gain is now only $200 for the year ($500 - $300). In this scenario, John only pays taxes on $200 of net capital gains rather than $500.

Tax Loss Harvesting With Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are treated as property for tax purposes, exactly the same as stocks. This means that you can also strategically sell/trade crypto to harvest losses and reduce your tax liability. Unlike stocks however, cryptocurrencies have unique characteristics that make them even better candidates for tax loss harvesting. We discuss these below. 

Wash Sale Rules

A wash sale results when you incur a capital loss, and then buy the same security back within a 30-day window before or after the capital loss is incurred. This rule is designed to prevent investors from taking capital losses in one year and then immediately buying back the stock. The [**IRS specifically states**](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2016_publink100010601) that wash sale rules only apply to securities. Cryptocurrencies are property, not securities, as defined by [**IRS guidance**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf). This means that wash sales rules do not apply to cryptocurrency at this time.

Volatility

Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile—more so than traditional assets. This volatility means that investors regularly have opportunities to realize and harvest capital losses. The difficult part for investors is identifying which of their cryptocurrencies in their portfolio have the highest **cost basis** (original purchase price) when compared to the current market price. These are the assets that present the greatest opportunity for tax savings. [**CryptoTrader.Tax**](https://www.cryptotrader.tax/) has a tax loss harvesting tool built into the app that allows users to automatically identify which of their cryptocurrencies present the greatest loss harvesting opportunity.

An Example

Amy has made $15,000 in capital gains from investing in the stock market this year. Amy has also been investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum. In December, Amy imports her cryptocurrency transactions into CryptoTrader.Tax and notices that her investments are down over $20,000 for the year. To harvest these losses, Amy trades all of her cryptocurrencies into Litecoin (thus incurring a [**taxable event**](https://www.cryptotrader.tax/blog/when-do-you-owe-taxes-on-your-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency) and realizing her losses). Amy’s losses in cryptocurrency complete offset all of her stock market gains, and she’s left with a $5,000 capital loss for the year.

Net Capital Losses Up to $3,000 Offset Ordinary Income

Whenever total capital gains and losses for the year add up to a negative number, a net capital loss is incurred. If the net capital loss is less than or equal to $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and filing a separate tax return), then that entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income—like the income from your job. Net losses exceeding $3,000 are rolled forward to subsequent years.  

December 31st is the Cutoff - Time is of The Essence!

It is important to keep in mind that the tax year ends on Dec. 31st—even though the filing deadline isn’t until April 15th. This means that you must harvest your losses prior to the end of the year if you want them to impact that year’s taxes. Many investors delay only to realize that they could have saved money on their tax bill if they would have sold or realized losses back in December.

Just like Christmas, while this has been on the minds of many investors for some time now, it’s fair to say that there is also no other day that brings this kind of anticipation as much as the Altseason. While it seems like a perpetual wait, many crypto holders with heavy bags have been waiting for a long time for this season to come. Anyone who has ever had an experience where these Altcoins gained their initial market valuation during a period of constant- uninterrupted uptrend knows this feeling.  


Before proceeding to what this positive sentiment is all about, to speak of, what are these Altcoins? The term comes from the words “alternative” and “coin” and simply refers to any crypto tokens that are not Bitcoin. On the other hand, altseason is just a period where the crypto market (as Bitcoin dominance wears out) becomes significantly positive. So to speak of, like a flower shop where most of its revenue comes from a single day and that's Valentine's day, [how does one make the most of this altseason?](https://kucoinblog.com/what-is-altseason-and-bitcoin-dominance-rd) Well, while the most awaited altseason doesn't happen today or may not even happen a week from now.
