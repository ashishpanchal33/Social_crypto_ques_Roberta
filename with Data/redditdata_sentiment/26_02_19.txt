Personally what still makes me hesitant:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Tether**, oh boy haven't we heard this now for about 1 ½ years. But for me it is still very, very, very risky to let Tether be the backbone of all liquidity in the crypto markets. If I am not mistaken, about 85 % of all volume for Bitcoin is in Tether.  
Do you guys remember this past fall when Tether broke it's peg and went below 90 cents, then redeemed $900 Million USDT, the price of Bitcoin crashed just shortly afterwards, and that crash did **not** look natural at all. The $6000 level looked as if it was artificially held.  
Then Tether [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-says-customers-can-once-again-deposit-and-redeem-fiat) on November 27th that they would make a redeemable system and would not be using Bitfinex as their proxy for USD &lt;-&gt; USDT anymore. However, not **ONE** redeemed USDT has been recorded besides Bitfinex since it's inception almost 3 months ago, you can see this [here at the Treasury](https://www.omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) for Tether.
2. **Bitfinex**, same old here too. The issues they've had with fiat withdrawals and their connections with companies such as Crypto Capital and Noble Bank does not look good, it looks very much alike QuadrigaCX.
3. **Mt.Gox** **redistribution of 150 000 + BTC**, many crypto holders blamed Mt.Gox as the source for the 2018 crash, since they sold off 30 000 BTC. I think this was mostly a false narrative, however the proceedings with Mt.Gox is going forward and the BTC could start to get redistributed this year. Hopefully we will know more at March 20th when they will hold their next committee meeting.
4. **Market correlation** and **amount of dead/copied/irrational** projects with tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of valuation. This makes it hard to see like we're getting close to a rational market.
5. **Fake volume / Leverage trading / Market manipulation**, this point goes hand in hand and explains some of the Bart action we get every now and then. Whales can enter leverage positions, then wash trade or simply buy on the market and profit their leverage trades. That's probably not going to be a good thing in the market, besides for the whales doing the manipulation.  


  
I also see great potential in crypto, but we discuss that 24/7, so I thought we could try to look at this market as objectively as possible.  
Hope you guys can fill in with more!"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|850288|public|self|What are the biggest risks you currently see for the crypto market in 2019?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/autcro/what_are_the_biggest_risks_you_currently_see_for/|all_ads|6|1551125542.0|FINANCE|709d50a8-1deb-11e4-9b08-12313b0b24aa|FINANCE|||||||||||2019-02-26 01:42:22+00:00|t3_autcro|0|77|0.84||0||||||||||||||||1553262123.0|||||||||||26_02_19|02_19|0.09943512|0.50272423|0.39784065|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0823168158531189|0.11424129456281662|0.01224549487233162|0.49923110008239746|0.2819773554801941|0.009987949393689632

I recently came across a new crypto/hardware company, [AMMBR](https://www.ammbr.com/), doing an ICO that contains at least 7 former members of the infamous Butterfly Labs company in varying capacities.

Interestingly enough, my curiosity was ~~peaked~~ piqued as a family member who was involved with BFL mentioned this project on Facebook and I automatically knew there had to be a connection to BFL because that family member knows practically nothing about cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, it seems he has not learned from his mistakes and is still participating in shady, possibly illicit activities, along with many of his former butts!

I’m now going to connect the dots for you to the people associated with SCAMMBR to show beyond a reasonable doubt that they are a quasi-reincarnation of BFL.

If you go to their website, [www.ammbr.com](https://www.ammbr.com/), you can see their team members. Here are some of note:

***1.) FORMER BFL Chief Technology Officer: Nasser Ghoseiri***

Nasser was the Iranian living in France and one of the three named defendants in the case brought against BFL by the FTC which BFL lost.

***2.) FORMER BFL VP of Marketing: Jeff Ownby***

Jeff is the infamous character who pulled the trick of buying [Buttcoin.org](https://buttcoin.org/) surreptitiously and then chanigng the negative articles to positive. Jeff isn’t listed on the official site, but he’s always worked behind the scenes from my experience as he was never listed as a BFL employee either. While he doesn’t list BFL on his LinkedIn profile, it’s fairly obvious when you read his experience at ForceStream.

Guess who else is on the team? After checking out their team page, I saw a photo with a few familiar faces. Wanna know who they are?

[SCAMMBR TEAM](https://i.redd.it/1x9f2tce4yi21.png)

**NOTABLE FIGURES IN PIC:**

1.) Third from the left is **The Infamous Josh Zerlan, aka Inaba, aka** [**u/NitroWolf**](https://np.reddit.com/u/NitroWolf)**, aka BagO’Dicks, former VP of Product Dev at BFL,** and now apparently consulting or a part of SCAMMBR according to the “Projects” section of his LinkedIn profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-zerlan-a4140478/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-zerlan-a4140478/)

2.) Four spots to the right of Josh is T**he Infamous Dave “The Knife” Mcclain, aka ""THE MOLE""**, **former BFL Account Manager**, who seems to be a part of it as well as he is pictured on their website with their team in a photo which also includes Josh. Not sure what he does there as he has little understanding of cryptocurrency or just about any technical development since the VCR.

**BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE!**

SCAMMBR was originally founded in 2017.

(SOURCE: [https://tokenmarket.net/blockchain/blockchain/assets/ammbr/](https://tokenmarket.net/blockchain/blockchain/assets/ammbr/))

(SOURCE: [https://www.coinopsy.com/dead-coins/ammbr/](https://www.coinopsy.com/dead-coins/ammbr/))

However it had two main issues which found itself on the dead coin list until it was recently resurrected, one being lack of interest/exchange listings and the other being a major security vulnerability in the smart contract, and the third being that anything BFL touches turns to shit.

**ISSUE ONE:** According to the Coinopsy link above, among other interesting reasons, they proclaimed that: *“Ammbr was founded in 2017 and is not trading on any exchanges. Was added to the dead coins list due to the fact they did not reach any exchanges after one year and they canceled the ICO.”*

SOURCE FOR 2017 ICO RELEASE: ([https://tokenmarket.net/blockchain/blockchain/assets/ammbr/](https://tokenmarket.net/blockchain/blockchain/assets/ammbr/))

**ISSUE TWO:THE SCAMMBR SMART CONTRACT BUG:**

**(SOURCE:** [**https://medium.com/coinmonks/an-inspection-on-ammbr-amr-bug-a53b4050d52**](https://medium.com/coinmonks/an-inspection-on-ammbr-amr-bug-a53b4050d52))

While this bug affected many ERC-20 contracts, on July 8th, 2018, *“John Wick Security Lab revealed highly risky transactions in* [*AMMBR(AMR)*](https://ammbr.com/) *contract. It contains an integer overflow bug that could be made use of by hackers calling batchTransfer(), resulting in transferring out tokens without limits.”*

This can be seen in this tweet by SCAMMBR where they had to change the smart contract:

[*https://twitter.com/ammbrplatform/status/1011124298868776960?lang=en*](https://twitter.com/ammbrplatform/status/1011124298868776960?lang=en)

**WE'RE NOT DONE YET! SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST!**

After doing further research on the SCAMMBR website, because nothing BFL is involved with is ever like it seems, I found some suspect/fake/front companies and astroturfing.

[r/AMMBRPlatform](https://np.reddit.com/r/AMMBRPlatform)

By all accounts, that sub is highly suspected of astroturfing by shills, employees and their families. Very few posts concern the actual project and the mods are mostly absent. All of the posts repeat the same lines or hashtags, but no comments. Mod [u/Jory-](https://np.reddit.com/u/Jory-) doesn't post much in cryptocurrency subs, while [u/AMMBRPlatform](https://np.reddit.com/u/AMMBRPlatform) has never posted.

**BLACKBIRD WALLET IS THE BFL BITSAFE:**

This is one of my favorite finds as it didn't occur to me until after doing most of my research, but then it clicked suddenly that I knew the design.

BITCOINTALK: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4685822.msg%msg\_id%](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4685822.msg%25msg_id%25)

SCAMMBRTECH posted on Bitcointalk on 7/16/18 regarding a new mobile wallet that has yet to come to market, the Blackbird Hardware Wallet. I had never heard of it and apparently, they wanted $299 for it from their shop. Which is...ridiculous. But let's compare the Blackbird Wallet to the BFL Bitsafe that was never released:

This price for a ticket is valid only until March, then it will be $1!   


By the way, each ticket has not 1, but as many as 7 chances to win.And money raffles take place almost everyday - quite often, aren't they?   
Hourly and daily raffles   


And yes, don't think that this is usual financial pyramid.   
Look yourself:   
In the lottery, there are open source smart contracts with Ether that guarantee its integrity.   
And the system Oraclize will ensure the openness of random number generation, which means no one can influence the outcome!

Just thought I'd share with you a live demonstration of my favorite crypto project. This is the Particl Open Marketplace that's going mainnet in late Q1. The application is entirely decentralized, meaning image hosting, escrow, moderation, payments, etc...everything is decentralized and doesn't require middlemen.   


I believe this is exactly how blockchain products should be made if they want to have a shot at mainstream adoption. I'm tired of the countless Qt wallets going around, it's 2019 for god's sake xD   


I'd also be very curious to see demos from other live blockchain products! If you got any video of a good looking and serious blockchain project, please link it here :)  


Cheers all!

As far as I know, a stock price is influenced by how well the company is doing. If I got stocks from google and google does well, I gain money.

But how is this working with cryptocurrency. Let's say I got one Bitcoin, I can't really tell if bitcoin is doing good business right? There's just the coin without a company behind it. I can only wait for the technology to improve and for more places to accept Bitcoin. But what is there for me to gain, how do I help when I have Bitcoin?

If I got stocks from a company, the company gets money in return and I indirectly help them.
This is atleast as far as I understand all this, correct me if I'm wrong.

I would like to hear from you guys if there's any correlation between a cryptocurrency and the development of the coin itself.

This blood bath made many people quite the market and has forced many people to lay low during these times.

Negativity seems to be trying to take over this ever dominant market and even few of the strongest believers of “Hodl” prophecy seem to be getting distracted by this wrath of the market.

News media companies are still known for lazy journalism and without even knowing what Crypto is, seem to be passing negative judgments on our holy grail.

Banks still cussing in front line about the drawbacks of crypto and on the backend adopting to it while fooling the mass public yet again.

Hard times.

But when the times are tough, what does a real man do? What do all real men do?

Panic?

Well yes, but what do we do to get back on our feet?

Yes, boys....

“WE RUB ONE OUT”

Yeah, that's right gentlemen and gentlemen. Let's rub one out with pride, let's bust our nuts to glorify the realm of crypto with the jizz of joy with the help of one and only “THOT COIN”.

You heard me.

The only coin that guarantees top Thots of the internet and Reddit right on your mobile/laptop screens. Get access to the best porn websites at up to 80% discounted rates with your hard and erect “THOT COIN”.

Built on the realm of ever-evolving Eth blockchain, we promise the Thot experience like never before. From Snapchat Premium Thots to Stinky Crack head Bitches, whatever your deal is, we got it all covered.

Remember - With the greatest Coin, come greatest Thots.

Do you know the average rate for a hotel room 30 years ago was $19? 

Today its $237.That's a 1300% increase. So it's not inconceivable to think that in another 30 years a week at a hotels runs you at 20 grand. 

But, enough of these pyramid scheme talks, We know you are going to be a millionaire by then. $20k won't mean shit to you. 

But hey, try to think what a Thot cost you 30 years back and what a Thot costs you now?

In another 30 years, if the fiat stays the same, getting a thot is gonna make even a billionaire broke. 

Dafuq you gonna do in that $20k hotel room without a hot Thot?

Fuck scams and fuck the shady ICO’s.

Do not let inflation kill your dreams of having a nice day with a hot Thot in the future. Thots are getting expensive and the fiat is dying. In the future, you don’t wanna earn in hundreds and pay in million for a juicy Thot.

Invest in cents and jizz on millions with one and only “Thot Coin” [ Slash Guitar Solo Plays ]

ICO dates would be posted soon here with the link to the official website.

P.s- Thot coin only promotes Thots over the age of 18 and are legal. No other Reddit account would be used for future posts. This is the only account being used by THOT Coin development team."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|850665|public|self|The future of Crypto is here.|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/av5pqw/the_future_of_crypto_is_here/|all_ads|6|1551201433.0|FOCUSED-DISCUSSION||FOCUSED-DISCUSSION|||||||||||2019-02-26 22:47:13+00:00|t3_av5pqw|0|4|0.55||0||||||||||||||||1553268769.0|||||||||||26_02_19|02_19|0.1058338|0.4481893|0.44597685|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.06887347251176834|0.13158805668354034|0.01260214764624834|0.5141336917877197|0.26247766613960266|0.010325027629733086

Who we empower on social media can impact our goal of digital asset adoption! Find out how - and get the latest XRP news - in my latest blog: 

&amp;nbsp;

𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐨 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: I profile Eva Kaili, a member of the European Parliament, and recommend that readers support her efforts online. 

&amp;nbsp;

𝐑𝐢𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: Two Ripple videos are released from the Ripple Regionals event(s), and I cover two of them: a presentation from Graham Bright, Euro Exim's Head of Compliance, and one from Alastair Constance, the Founder and Director of Mercury FX. 

&amp;nbsp;

𝐗𝐑𝐏 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬: @LeoHadjiloizou (Twitter) creates a fantastic XRP ecosystem graphic; Bithomp creates a Twitter bot for price alerts; Coinbase Pro adds XRP pairings against USD and the EURO; Eurex plans on adding XRP derivatives; OKEx adds XRP support for its C2C platform; and the @CrpToe_Man (Twitter) offers a deal on ""XRP art"" prints paired with charitable donations.  

&amp;nbsp;

I hope you enjoy the read!
