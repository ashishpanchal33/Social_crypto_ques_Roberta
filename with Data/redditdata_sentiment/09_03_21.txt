One day i met a guy in the library who was looking for a particular book on cryptocurrency, i can’t remember what it was but I’m sure it was cryptocurrency for dummies or something similar. We got to chatting and i set him up on Coinbase, Binance, Mercatox, Huobi, Nexo (wasnt aware of celsius etc at the time) CoinMarketCap and Blockfolio and gave him a list of 5 cryptocurrencies that i was investing in at the time that he should research and decide if he wants to invest into as well. He decided that day that he would invest in all of them just from the way he said i spoke so passionately about them and really seemed to know what i was talking about (this one still amuses me as I’m sure i know less now than i did then).

Today i received this [message](https://imgur.com/a/InYYYuH) out of the blue. 

Text Version:

“Hi ***** its **** *******, I’m not sure if you will remember me, i hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to let you know that thanks to your advice and help i managed to put money away every month and i invested it across 4 of the 5 cryptocurrencies you told me about when you said which ones would make good long term investments. 

2 months ago my dad was diagnosed with stage 2 lung cancer and with everything going on he was going to be waiting a while for surgery but thanks to you i was able to pay for him to get private surgery as soon as possible and hopefully have just enough left over to pay for him to get the best care until he recovers. I made sure to check and pay my taxes on it first as well like you said i should do if i ever did invest. 

I wish i could repay you somehow or give you a share of the profits but for now i will only be able to repeatedly say thank you, you helped save my dad’s life and my family and I can not thank you enough. I hope to one day show you a token of my gratitude for this. I told you before, i knew there was i reason i met you. This proves it. From the bottom of my heart thank you.”

This really made me smile.

Having had to sell pretty much all of my cryptocurrency over the last year at a loss just to survive I’ve been feeling quite down in the dumps having watched it explode over the last few months but receiving this message has made me feel so much better because at least if i couldn’t benefit from the increase lately then at least someone else and their family got to benefit thanks to the cryptos i picked out.

Cryptocurrency is changing lives around the world and still there is people who don’t believe in it or the underlying technology behind it. As someone who has known about bitcoin and the crypto space since pre-ethereum days i am really excited to see how the space as a whole advances over the next 10 years."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1872202|public|self|Almost 2 years ago before i dropped out of Uni, i gave what may have been the best advice I’ve ever given.|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m17it0/almost_2_years_ago_before_i_dropped_out_of_uni_i/|all_ads|6|1615280342.0|EDUCATIONAL||EDUCATIONAL|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '6fTQAWsPB6Ed7zozV6_u-ymyLP54Z8LFK5I0JFZOc4A', 'resolutions': [{'height': 192, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vyP8O28emTwyBH9PUFHV1nY_LXsqCNjOnbMtegh2w6Q.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c02d10b5316ab4244931b54907a8002ab3b9ccb6', 'width': 108}, {'height': 384, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vyP8O28emTwyBH9PUFHV1nY_LXsqCNjOnbMtegh2w6Q.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c82253825a6c487ff05d42e7c32ae611b5a9da4', 'width': 216}, {'height': 568, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vyP8O28emTwyBH9PUFHV1nY_LXsqCNjOnbMtegh2w6Q.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9817c44cf85ac3c70058c3c10f7c514854a68ebf', 'width': 320}, {'height': 1137, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vyP8O28emTwyBH9PUFHV1nY_LXsqCNjOnbMtegh2w6Q.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=193cba1597fdcdc9a1d93da3bb5feada3da4f42c', 'width': 640}, {'height': 1706, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vyP8O28emTwyBH9PUFHV1nY_LXsqCNjOnbMtegh2w6Q.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dda1e0c01131219b2fb5b8bfa3563812ef7456f1', 'width': 960}, {'height': 1920, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vyP8O28emTwyBH9PUFHV1nY_LXsqCNjOnbMtegh2w6Q.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dba6d205d217e32e5eb5b44563c5729240917da7', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 2048, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vyP8O28emTwyBH9PUFHV1nY_LXsqCNjOnbMtegh2w6Q.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=bcb7ee177227fde099f4e436af19411c0dd5c305', 'width': 1152}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||2021-03-09 14:29:02+00:00|t3_m17it0|0|83|0.74||5||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||09_03_21|03_21|0.13876511|0.43744275|0.4237922|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0502968467772007|0.11756440997123718|0.007791576907038689|0.5525232553482056|0.2615329921245575|0.010290921665728092

We are in the market, where most of the people who have bought i last 6 months are deep in profit. The market seems bullish and I believe it can still remain like that for some time.

However, it does not mean that you shouldn't take profits. Any profit is good profit. Whether it is 10% or 2000% it is worth to take same of the profits and just feel that you earned some money. It's much much better to sell for small profit than to become bagholder for a long time. Bagholding will wreck you mentally. And by saying that I mean it will really wreck you unless you have nerves of steel. Imagine that you bough at coin that dropped 50%. In order for it to go back for you to break even it needs to go up 100%. So at the same time you not only need for it to go more than it dropped (percentage-wise), others will be doubling their profits while you will be barely breaking even. 

People who bought ADA 3 years ago at ATH, even after breaking even this year, they didnt make any profit for 3 years and lost some due to inlfation (not to mention opportunity cost).

I know there is strong ""HODL"" mentality among people here, but remember in the end everyone is trading for themselves. People tend to write ""HODL"", but you cant know what their financial situation is. Maybe they are just teenagers and invested few hundred bucks for fun and memes, even if they lose 500$ then its nothing. Or maybe they are gamblers (there are a lot of gamblers here) who get high when they risk and lose (or win) their money. But if you are trying to FOMO and invest bigger sums, it can quickly go bad, and no amount of memes can make it back what you lost. 

If you really want to HODL, imagine yourself bagholding several years with 90% portfolio loss of value (which is pretty common in crypto) and at the same time people getting 10000% of return on their investment. If this scenario does not sound painful to you then HODL mentality might be ok for you. But at the end of the day it might not be and you will be regretting not selling when you are 20% up, then you start hating cryptos adn when the actual good (Second) time to invest will come you will miss it again and regret it even more. 

As with another great bull run, there will same amount of newly made bagholders and millionaries. Because those newly made millionaries had to unload their cryptos to someone right?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Remember there is **ALWAYS** another play, but if you are bagholder then you can hardly do anything.

If you're in the USA and you exchange $200 or less to a foreign currency, and transfer it back. Then you don't get taxed. So like if you go on vacation or whatever. But with crypto, this isn't the case at all. It's actually treated in the eyes of the gov as the same way a stock or baseball card would be. 

NOTE: I'm not a tax person. But as far as I can tell if you bought something or transfer that foreign money to another, then that isn't taxed. While in crypto this 100% happens. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like I think if I transfer the £ to ¥, I don't think the IRS can or does tax that. Where if I transfer BTC to ETH that does happen as far as I can tell. And I don't think if you took ¥ and bought something, that is taxed by the IRS. But if you bought 25 cent gum with BTC then it 100% is.

I've seen a lot of posts in this sub about their personal wins and I'd like to share my very small personal moon with you.

I invested in 2018, at the peak into...TRX. Roughly £800 lovely GBP. On the recommendation of a work colleage, my **boss** no less. Fuck!

Naturally, this over halved and I lost around 55% of my TRX. I ignored it, tried to HODL till late 2020 and realised my mistake of investing in TRX, especially on simply anothers word. I decided to get out, realise my losses of 55% and reinvest the rest.

I put around £400 in BTC/ETH/ADA in December and watched my 55% loss turn to 0% losses. Then into profit. I was GOBSMACKED. This was admittedly, very lucky timing on my part. I went for the two biggies and after about 5-10 hours research, ADA. This simple decision taught me one thing I'll never let go of:

***DYOR and never invest more than you can afford to lose***

I cashed out my losses and thought I'd start fresh. I re-invested the original amount and now sit at $1100. 

I'm really, really looking forward to the long term again in crypto. Seeing losses turn into profits really spurred me on.

I've been in crypto for years. I've seen all kinds of shitcoins come and go. I remember some hype around NEM back in the day and then nothing. Complete radio silence. Now that happens with hundreds of coins, but the difference is those coins fade into obscurity and out of the top 100.

NEM seems to have faded into obscurity but is still somehow permanently in the top 20. When was the last time you saw a post about NEM? a meme? I have never once seen anyone on CNBC, Bloomberg, youtube or a crypto podcast even in passing mention NEM. I've heard more about shitcoins that are 400th on CoinGecko than I do NEM. It seems to be no ones coin, in no ones indexes.

It doesn't have shill armies desperately posting propping up it's value. Where is its top 20 permanence coming from? Who are these silent hardcore NEM holders? Is there some African nation that has secretly moved their economy to NEM and not told anyone? 

I don't think I have seen anyone post about NEM in over 5 years. Even though its right there. On everyones blockfolio, sitting there in the top 20. It's been there so long you don't even notice it, like a crack in your phone screen. It just remains. Ever present but invisible. A phantom. It's a complete enigma to me.

As we've moved memes to R/cryptomemes (or whatever we called it) can we also make a R/cryptofeelgood subreddit to post those story's? 

Because now all the quality content about coins and other important stuf gets washed away because of these posts. When feel good story's are getting more and more out of hand it feels like this is just the beginning of the end now. K

Can a mod make a poll about these posts? 
- Move feel good posts to R/cryptofeelgood
- Make a feel good Friday
- Just let people post their feel good story's

During the last 6 months I felt more at ease seeing ups and downs on my crypto portfolio than in my stock portfolio. 

I don't feel the urge for my cryptos to read every small headline that could affect my investment. If cryptos are down, I sometimes even hope they would drop more so that I could, for example, buy a BTC at corona levels. BTC can't say 'nah, we are planning for moderate growth next year' or 'well, we have to raise money to grow further'.

For my stocks, it's different. Last three weeks were really bad and I constantly ask myself if my decisions are right or not. 

I love my crypto portfolio and it made me smile in the last few weeks, even if it wasn't performing that strong.

Thankfully, I had previously removed all SMS-based logins and password resets, so there was no damage. Had I not done that, the damage would have been catastrophic, as the attacker had 7 hours of free reign before I woke up and contacted my phone provider.

Who are 465DI and what are we working on?

So there has been a few discussions around who we are, what we are doing with Nano and the usual digging to see what really might be going on. Lets give some background.

465 is a private equity group, founded by myself (Duncan) to manage various investments which have predominantly been in the technology, fintech and payments sectors. Our group is actually quite wide, having investments in roughly 90 companies spread fairly globally. We were an early stage investor in Facebook, Deliveroo and Revolut to name a few house hold names.

My background is technology and high frequency trading. Having started out building computers at a young age, I turned this into a business whilst at school which I ultimately sold in my early twenties. I then moved to the big smoke (London) and started working for a Chicago based prop fund called First Continental. I designed and built both hardware and software for their automated bond arbitrage systems. Laterly, I co-founded Kineta trading, a high frequency prop firm specialising in FX Arbitrage between Chicago and New York. If you have read flash boys, or seen the Hummingbird Project this was our game – latency arbitrage (This may be why I like Nano so much – I hate latency).

Post Kineta, another market maker specialising in FX was founded, Xenfin, which still runs today. It transacts a few billion of FX every day in a fully electronic, automated fashion in both New York, London and Tokyo. Our clients are predominantly banks.

Crypto became a hobby for me in early 2011, when we started to look at ASICS for bitcoin, we were already mining a few Alts on GPU’s, and in the early days also BTC. As a result, we built a mining company predominantly based in the UK, utilising the power from a renewable power plant that we also own. Today, we still mine BTC and ETH predominantly.

We have various other large scale projects in the banking and payments space. I am the chairman of a challenger bank based in Barcelona (NEO), and soon to also launch in the UK, that has aspirations to bolt on crypto to its offering.

Our group, also has some other well known individuals in the crypto space as part of it. These will become more visible as we build out. 465DI was built to consolidate our ‘crypto and blockchain’ holdings into a single entity.

So what are we working on and why Nano?

George &amp; Colin came to Xenfin with the very early idea of using nano in an FX pipeline and since then we have been watching nano with interest. Our next step is to see whether we can integrate nano into Neo, and how we can use it as payment rails for countries where payments are inefficient and expensive. Nano for us solves a few major issues, time for finality, and cost. These are the two main items that affect payments rails today in the traditional banking world. There are other issues, such as KYC, AML, banks holding funds etc that are also issues but that is not for discussion here. One other major issue that causes issues with other crypto’s is the TPS issue. The recent ‘Spam’ attack has shown the network is resilient, but that there are still things to address.

We have two main projects in the works right now:

(a) Crypto ATM’S, whilst people have thought we are producing a solely Nano ATM, that’s not the case, we will be providing ATM’s in multiple jurisdictions that can support the major Cryptos and also Nano. However, we will be pushing Nano as we believe it is the most efficient and cheapest crypto to enable worldwide payments. Think of a simple use case, the Dubai – India cash route back home. Workers in Dubai, send money back home. The current traditional routes can charge 10% for this and it takes days. With ATM’s / Nano you can pay into an ATM In Dubai, it arrives (via Nano) to the receiver almost instantly ready for withdrawal. These will be launched under the brand “Pinger” via www.pinger.cash in the coming months. We will be launching the website to show likely jurisdictions and to request partners / suggested locations for machines. We will operate these on a Joint Venture basis with local operators who will manage the ‘on the ground’ logistics.

(b) Institutional Nano Custody / Fiat – I am running a project at Neo to enable this. You will be able to hold nano with Neo, and instantly transfer between major currencies at wholesale rates. Currently this will be offered for Institutions / Corporates only. This will change long term to broaden user coverage.

Two other points:

(a) Relationship with Binance – for the record there is nothing official. We are using Binance for on road / off road fiat rails currently; this may change. However, we have committed to running large scale, robust nodes for Nano and Binance selected us to be used for their needs.

(b) We are happy to support Nano Projects with Hardware if it makes sense for us to do so. Feel free to PM if you have an interesting project that needs support.

We are keen to listen, I’m not very active on here, but plan to be. I like healthy debate, I like solving problems and I like to build things. I see a lot of people looking at the price of Nano, and sure I assume for most, this is just another investible with a potential return. We see it different, a utility that could allow the unbanked to be banked more easily. The by-product of adoption is an increase in price which in the long run isn’t a bad thing either."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1871258|public|self|465di Private Equity group are developing NANO ATMs and more|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m13z6p/465di_private_equity_group_are_developing_nano/|all_ads|6|1615267082.0|FINANCE|709d50a8-1deb-11e4-9b08-12313b0b24aa|FINANCE|||||||||||2021-03-09 10:48:02+00:00|t3_m13z6p|0|12|0.93||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||09_03_21|03_21|0.07187713|0.45825958|0.4698632|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.10910746455192566|0.27128034830093384|0.02510572411119938|0.3589174747467041|0.21531258523464203|0.020276449620723724

I've been interested in crypto for many years and put my first few bucks into bitcoin and Ethereum in 2017 but I never really understood how exactly it worked. In the last few months I've been researching more and more how crypto actually works and slowly have been putting money into the big names I see like cardano, stellar lumens, nano, Ethereum and bitcoin.

My question is what do you think is the most stable coin to use as a savings account or a way to hedge against inflation?

NFTs is the ""New"" hot thing in crypto right now, People pay 10-2.5mil$ to buy an NFT.

NFT can be A [Tweet](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-taking-005308964.html) , A Clip from [NBA](https://www.nbatopshot.com/), A Picture or a [GIF](https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/my-last-effort--16458).

I Don't to want to claim that I Understand the motives behind these NFTs but **maybe just maybe** This is the Future.

# Year 2050:

we will Welcome our guests to our home, Lead them to our VR AR Room and show them all of our Digital art collection.

The room will be Empty as fk, maybe with some carpets and some cool lighting that will bring the best of our Digital Art Collection, We will show them Crazy Tweets, NBA clips and more.

The guest wouldn't need to do anything special to see our collections because they already can see them with their **Smart-Glasses** that everyone is wearing these days.

After that we will have some nice dinner made in the **Super-Microwave** by a luxurious capsules I bought with 0.00005 Bitcoin and they will ask us about the Digital painting that is represented on one of the walls.

One of my guests REALLY love that painting (even tho I painted it in Paint2045.exe) and he wants to buy it for 0.005 Bitcoin! OMG im so excited right now!

We hop into our favorite wallet and exchange it in a fast and feeless way.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe It's the future, Maybe I have seen too many movies, Either way we are gonna have a great ride.

What do you think on the future of NFTs?

So, I won like $1,900 or so last year on the pokies, their only withdrawal method was via bitcoin and i made a coinbase account

iirc, i can't wd directly from coinbase, so should i buy a hardware wallet? I think it's doubled by now and I don't need the money and I'm not certain how safe coinbase is.

thanks :)"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1869654|public|self|Coinbase and hardware wallets|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m0xqjb/coinbase_and_hardware_wallets/|all_ads|6|1615240883.0|EXCHANGE||EXCHANGE|||||||||||2021-03-09 03:31:23+00:00|t3_m0xqjb|0|6|0.75||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||09_03_21|03_21|0.11076456|0.4499968|0.43923864|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07071885466575623|0.20293867588043213|0.01466779038310051|0.2337827980518341|0.4597536027431488|0.018138350918889046

I will share the link to the original post in the comments. Original submission below:




Who are 465DI and what are we working on?

So there has been a few discussions around who we are, what we are doing with Nano and the usual digging to see what really might be going on. Lets give some background.

465 is a private equity group, founded by myself (Duncan) to manage various investments which have predominantly been in the technology, fintech and payments sectors. Our group is actually quite wide, having investments in roughly 90 companies spread fairly globally. We were an early stage investor in Facebook, Deliveroo and Revolut to name a few house hold names.

My background is technology and high frequency trading. Having started out building computers at a young age, I turned this into a business whilst at school which I ultimately sold in my early twenties. I then moved to the big smoke (London) and started working for a Chicago based prop fund called First Continental. I designed and built both hardware and software for their automated bond arbitrage systems. Laterly, I co-founded Kineta trading, a high frequency prop firm specialising in FX Arbitrage between Chicago and New York. If you have read flash boys, or seen the Hummingbird Project this was our game – latency arbitrage (This may be why I like Nano so much – I hate latency). 

Post Kineta, another market maker specialising in FX was founded, Xenfin, which still runs today. It transacts a few billion of FX every day in a fully electronic, automated fashion in both New York, London and Tokyo. Our clients are predominantly banks. 

Crypto became a hobby for me in early 2011, when we started to look at ASICS for bitcoin, we were already mining a few Alts on GPU’s, and in the early days also BTC. As a result, we built a mining company predominantly based in the UK, utilising the power from a renewable power plant that we also own. Today, we still mine BTC and ETH predominantly. 

We have various other large scale projects in the banking and payments space. I am the chairman of a challenger bank based in Barcelona (NEO), and soon to also launch in the UK, that has aspirations to bolt on crypto to its offering.

Our group, also has some other well known individuals in the crypto space as part of it. These will become more visible as we build out. 465DI was built to consolidate our ‘crypto and blockchain’ holdings into a single entity.

So what are we working on and why Nano?

George &amp; Colin came to Xenfin with the very early idea of using nano in an FX pipeline and since then we have been watching nano with interest. Our next step is to see whether we can integrate nano into Neo, and how we can use it as payment rails for countries where payments are inefficient and expensive. Nano for us solves a few major issues, time for finality, and cost. These are the two main items that affect payments rails today in the traditional banking world. There are other issues, such as KYC, AML, banks holding funds etc that are also issues but that is not for discussion here. One other major issue that causes issues with other crypto’s is the TPS issue. The recent ‘Spam’ attack has shown the network is resilient, but that there are still things to address.

We have two main projects in the works right now:

(a) Crypto ATM’S, whilst people have thought we are producing a solely Nano ATM, that’s not the case, we will be providing ATM’s in multiple jurisdictions that can support the major Cryptos and also Nano. However, we will be pushing Nano as we believe it is the most efficient and cheapest crypto to enable worldwide payments. Think of a simple use case, the Dubai – India cash route back home. Workers in Dubai, send money back home. The current traditional routes can charge 10% for this and it takes days. With ATM’s / Nano you can pay into an ATM In Dubai, it arrives (via Nano) to the receiver almost instantly ready for withdrawal. These will be launched under the brand “Pinger” via www.pinger.cash in the coming months. We will be launching the website to show likely jurisdictions and to request partners / suggested locations for machines. We will operate these on a Joint Venture basis with local operators who will manage the ‘on the ground’ logistics.

(b) Institutional Nano Custody / Fiat – I am running a project at Neo to enable this. You will be able to hold nano with Neo, and instantly transfer between major currencies at wholesale rates. Currently this will be offered for Institutions / Corporates only. This will change long term to broaden user coverage.

Two other points:

(a) Relationship with Binance – for the record there is nothing official. We are using Binance for on road / off road fiat rails currently; this may change. However, we have committed to running large scale, robust nodes for Nano and Binance selected us to be used for their needs.

(b) We are happy to support Nano Projects with Hardware if it makes sense for us to do so. Feel free to PM if you have an interesting project that needs support. 

We are keen to listen, I’m not very active on here, but plan to be. I like healthy debate, I like solving problems and I like to build things. I see a lot of people looking at the price of Nano, and sure I assume for most, this is just another investible with a potential return. We see it different, a utility that could allow the unbanked to be banked more easily. The by-product of adoption is an increase in price which in the long run isn’t a bad thing either."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1871505|public|self|ATMs featuring Nano coming soon and much more...|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m14q2f/atms_featuring_nano_coming_soon_and_much_more/|all_ads|6|1615270381.0|ADOPTION||ADOPTION|||||||||||2021-03-09 11:43:01+00:00|t3_m14q2f|0|10|0.86||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||09_03_21|03_21|0.13876511|0.43744275|0.4237922|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0502968467772007|0.11756440997123718|0.007791576907038689|0.5525232553482056|0.2615329921245575|0.010290921665728092

Now to my question:


I must admit that I have not done any in-depth research myself, however, when I look at the coins/tokens that are traded on Coinbase, for example, historically they’ve all increased in value if you didn’t happen to buy during a major, short-term high. My question goes to the people who’ve been trading cryptos longer than the average (I imagine rather recent) users here: are there any investments of yours that have really taken a nose-dive for you? 

I‘d be curious to see the responses as it feels like, so far, I’ve only seen success stories along the lines of “I’ve invested $1000 dollars every year into the most hyped crypto and my investment has more than doubled over 4 years“."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1871483|public|self|About return history|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m14okm/about_return_history/|all_ads|6|1615270203.0|TRADING|b0dd934c-ad7d-11e7-8466-0e3335a91874|TRADING|||||||||||2021-03-09 11:40:03+00:00|t3_m14okm|0|4|0.83||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||09_03_21|03_21|0.13876511|0.43744275|0.4237922|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0502968467772007|0.11756440997123718|0.007791576907038689|0.5525232553482056|0.2615329921245575|0.010290921665728092

It started innocently enough...I had some big plans of surprising my family with a dream vacation with the earning off my coins. We live a very strict life and putting the money into crypto means we don't have extra for little things like takeout or new video games. I am the only one employed in my household and I control the budget so she never even knew this money existed. 

I posted here asking if anyone else was saving up to surprise family like me and it helped me realize keeping this money secret was a very bad call. Lots more benefit to keeping her in the loop. What originally held me back was that I was worried she wouldn't be supportive of the gamble as she unfortunately has had a lot of negative opinions of crypto around her due to people she know who lost money selling low. 

I still wanted to surprise my family with something so I pulled out a bit of gains and grabbed a Nintendo Switch to bring home to start off the conversation with a bang! It didn't go that well at first tbh. I surprised them with the switch and right away my wife was giving me some eyeballs. Just like a bandaid I just blurted it out that I've been putting money in crypto and it's been working out well. I explained that I got this off gains and my original investment still going strong. It was met with a bit of a freak out considering our situation and the sum. Fears of losing it all and what we could use it for today came up.. but overall she understands what I am doing and is actually very excited. 

I told her I wanted to plan a big trip with her and I wish I could share her smile with you all. Weve haven't been on a trip together in our 10 years together and this is very exciting for us. We've been planning our trip pretty much since and it's alowed many more conversations about my crypto and how exciting things are looking potentially. She even wants to accept crypto for her etsy shop and private sewing work! I'm so excited for this!!! Big things are happening!!!

No shills allowed. No mention of any crypto whatsoever.

I’d like to know what everyone’s actual process is for investing in a crypto.

For example:

1. I hear about something on A Discord Channel I’m registered to

2. I go to the crypto website to read the white paper and get a feel for the team behind the project

3. I head over to CoinMarketCap and check what the current price is and how many tokens are in circulation.

4. I invest £1000 in the crypto if it’s interesting or £2000 if I think it could moon.

5. I hold until it’s either made me a 50% ROI or it drops 10% below my buy price and take the loss

Really interested to see how many people actually apply a technical or methodical approach to crypto investment, rather than a totally random “sounds like it could pump, take my money!”

I am a lonely person in this world, with no real friends. I know it's weird for a guy in his 40's to consider dad his best friend, but everybody has different circumstances in life that lead to what their current life is today. 

I recently started investing in Dogecoin and finally brought it up in a conversation on our way to the store yesterday. I did my best to explain crypto to him in simple terms to the best of my ability. I think he understood, or at least the basics. He came out very unsupportive, told me he thought I was a dumb fool, took me out behind the woodshed and beat the tar out of me with his belt. 

This might not sound like much to you for for me it meant a lot because he usually just mumbles when I talk and never pays much attention to me or anything I do. Even though I won’t be able to sit down for a week, at least I know he cares enough to keep me from making idiotic mistakes. 

I recently joined this subreddit and people here have downvoted me and told me to stop listening to Elon. I post this because I really don't have anyone else to tell. Even Elon won’t tweet me back.

NFTs are just *smart contracts for ownership*. In other words, one of the most anticipated use cases for smart contracts.

-	Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin take the concept of physical money (eg gold) to the digital realm (blockchain.

-	NFTs do the same thing with the concept of ownership. 

They require making the same logical leap. Like you probably struggled to first accept how digital currency could hold any value, people will also struggle to accept how a smart contract could mean ownership. 

NFTs can be used for literally any situation that involves transfer of ownership. 

Issues facing NFT ownership today:

-	**NFT ownership is not legally backed:** like cryptocurrencies were not legally accepted, neither is NFT-defined ownership today 
-	**Scams**: Like real life, you must trust the seller to not be a scammer and sell the same thing to multiple people. You must also trust the seller to be an authoritative source (can I sell you some [land on the moon?](https://lunarland.com))
-	**Standardization**: There is no general/standardized approach to construction of NFTs, so the value of NFTs issued until such a moment are questionable


Issues NOT facing NFTs today - misconceptions floated about in this community:

-	**NFT-backed content only exists so long as the creator exists:** False. When buying something digital, like a tweet or an image, so long as the hash of the content is encoded in the NFT, and the original content exists *somewhere*, you can prove ownership. IPFS is a common solution to pinning NFT-backed content.
-	**Anyone can create an NFT:** True, but *not an issue.* Only NFT’s stemming from the owner’s address (or otherwise authoritative source) would have any real value. Both Nike and Joe Blow could issue an NFT for the original first pair of Yeezy’s, but the former holds value and the latter is noise on the blockchain to ignore.
-	**NFT-backed data can be duplicated:** True, but *not a huge issue.* If you could make a million perfect copies of the Mona Lisa down to the atom, people would still pick the original. **THAT SAID,** NFT ownership makes much more sense for physical (real-world) items today (ie an NFT that says you own a concert ticket).

Cool potential use cases for NFTs:

-	**Physically decentralized ownership:** Own something that’s not colocated to you. You can buy ownership of, say, a famous painting in a secure warehouse, or a gold bar in a reserve. These are things you can already do today, NFTs just put it on the blockchain and cut out the middleman.
-	**Transfer of ownership:** Create an item, and when it’s sold, you get a cut of it. Transferring ownership is as simple as sending someone the NFT.
-	**Literally anything related to ownership:** If you can relate the activity to ownership, you can probably relate NFTs to them to.


**TL;DR:** NFTs are just smart contracts for ownership. You know, one of the *most anticipated uses of smart contracts*. They can be used for dumb things (like selling a tweet) or cool things (like selling movie tickets) in a decentralized manner that cuts out the middleman."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1873878|public|self|NFTs are just smart contracts for ownership.

Real estate, agriculture, stocks, just about any asset can be digitized and issued using the blockchain. Unfortunately at that time, the world was not quite ready for this revolutionary and disruptive technology. Fast forward the clock several years to today, and now the regulatory and technological roadblocks that once hindered these projects are now clear. Countries are becoming more progressive towards cryptocurrency and are ready to utilize it with a real and legitimate use case on the blockchain.  

Below, is a quick look at 3 projects hanging around from 2017 that are now ready to revolutionize the industry.   

&amp;#x200B;

**Smartlands (SLT)**   

This is a small cap gem that has huge growth potential. The Smartlands platform will be going live very soon, and is currently in negotiations with several JV's and HNWI's about potential projects to launch on their platform. (The CEO is also currently in negotiations with a Tier 1 exchange.) Smartlands leverages blockchain technology to reduce cost of upwards 50% to entrepreneurs raising funds, companies digitizing and issuing their assets on the blockchain, and fund managers who want to digitize their funds for investors. This platform uses the Stellar network, which utilizes the Stellar Consensus Protocol to efficiently verify transactions on the blockchain. The SLT token will be used to pay for fees on the platform, and 33% of fees received  will go back to SLT owners who have their tokens staked. This project is one to keep an eye on and has great potential ROI in relation to it's current market cap.   

Max Circulating Supply Only 7.1 millions Tokens   

Market Cap 33 Million   

Current Price $6.54   

&amp;#x200B;

**Polymath (POLY)**   

Polymath is another platform that can be used to create, issue, and manage assets on the blockchain. The Polymath network is a decentralized platform, and the POLY token is its utility token. This token can be staked and is used as ""Fuel"" to run transactions interact with smart contracts on the network. Polymath's all time high was $1.56, and is still a way off from its current price, so it should have some good growth potential there. The Polymath network is set to go live with Polymesh at the end of March and is readily available on most exchanges.   

Max Circulating Supply 1 Billion Tokens   

Market Cap 260 Million   

Current Price $.43   

&amp;#x200B;

**Ravencoin (RVN)**   

Ravencoin is a digital peer to peer network that aims to implement a use case specific blockchain, designed to efficiently handle one specific function: the transfer of assets from one party to another. RVN is actually a fork on the bitcoin code and has been around since January 3rd, 2018. It utilizes POW (Proof Of Work) to verify and initiate the transfer of assets on the blockchain. RVN has been on quite the run lately, and in over a little over a month it has gone from $.07 to $.18.  

Max Circulating Supply 21 Billion Tokens   

Market Cap 1.5 Billion   

Current Price $.18   

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to keep it short and concise on each project, but to do it real justice I would need to write a lot more information. These projects will are poised to do really well because they have a real use case that is ready to be unleashed.

I have posted this previously however I have since fixed a few things which were causing issues for some people. As requested this is an updated version.

This is a spreadsheet that I have developed for myself gradually over a few years. I have found it very helpful for keeping track of my crypto holdings (good for tax purposes). No need to trust third party apps to keep your personal information - track it yourself.

There is a lot in here;

Automatically updates prices from coinmarketcap. The top 200 coins included. Just select which ones you want to track by typing in the ticker symbol. 

You can choose your local Fiat currency and get live conversion rates for any fiat currency.

I don't record details of every trade. Just keep track of your crypto purchases (from fiat) and what coins you currently hold. The spreadsheet will calculate the rest and keep a record of how your portfolio and holdings have changed over time (it logs this data every time you save the sheet)

I find this very handy to see if your trading is actually profitable compared to the HODL method.

There are also plenty of 'moon math' and analytics to see how bitcoin is trending. This includes a full history of bitcoins price which updates every time you open the sheet.

A few more charts because I like charts;

Also has a simple 'regret calculator' to more than satisfy your regret quota for the day;

free download from here. Instructions inside. You will need macros enabled if you want it to do the fancy stuff.

Hope this is helpful to you in some way. Let me know if you have any issues - I will try and help if you catch me at a good time.

# - Trending Stocks Pages

For Reddit, you'll be also able to select a specific thread and time granularity to check the stocks that have been discussed the most in these specific subreddit. You will be able to see the Current Trending Score and Previous one, to see if a recent hype is building up around a stock. Same for Twitter &amp; Google

# - Top Movers

This page allow you to check the stocks that had the biggest jump in the trending lists specified above. The objective is to help you catch the trending stocks before they become too mainstream and spot them as soon they have an increasing weight in the discussions.

# - Reddit Trending Index

This index has been built to show you what kind of performance would you except yourself to have if you had to blindly buy the 10 most discussed stocks in Reddit.

You can check out all that at  [HERE](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php) !

Can someone suggest an exchange for me.  I'm in the U.S.  Here is what I plan to do.

every 2 weeks I'm taking 100 dollars and buying alt coins that I've been researching for the last 2 weeks.  I may hold them, I may trade them at the end of each day.  I've been tracking and reading about certain ones I think could grow in the next few weeks.  So there would be some trade fees that I'd have to account for so i'd like a low fee. 

I'm also planning on putting about 1000 dollars in btc and or eth or maybe another and sitting on it and funding it more as I have some disposable income.  

Basically I want to sit on some coin like btc and also spend some time possibly investing in some of these alt coins and newer projects.

Right, so first up we have more upwards growth and this is approaching my current trade channel upper limit, however, we are still a way off of securing the new level of support by breaking through the 23.8% line on the Fib Extension tool, this means we need to see the price move above $4.82 and stay above that price to know that 1INCH is well and truly on it's way. Whilst it stays in the range between 0% and 23.8%, we will continue to consolidate, however, if the trend continues then we could see the price securely above $4.82 by the start of next week.

The price action has crossed the Bollinger Band median line which is a bullish indication that a upward trend is currently here to stay for the next day or two. You all will note that the price action is also still well and firmly in the trade zone created by my linear projection lines which is a good confirmation that 1INCH is on the right track to securing a good finish at the end of this year.

The RSI and StochRSI are divergent with the RSI lagging in the trade zone as the StochRSI moves towards being overbought, this would be an indication that the current small pump is running out of steam and will look to stabilise at around $4.35 before trying to gain more ground.

The MACD is at the point of a crossover where it looks like it will take one more day of action to confirm if we do indeed have a bullish indication on the trend of 1INCH so do keep an eye out for tomorrow's report as I will be monitoring this closely.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 1qf0xevaw1m61...*

The depth chart looks bearish on the overall picture as the buyer to seller ratio stands at 3.3:1 in favour of sellers but the buyers control the current price action and if this continues over the next day or two then we may see a full push to $4.5 as we head in to the weekend, however, I would be cautious as this seems like a little over-extension on the price and would suggest that we could see a move back to more stable ground at $4.3.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2eq5zwdbw1m61.png?width=2512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6db7e6b5897cfa559fd7ba51f02208092f2b2947

Currently, the volume profile for the past 14 days of 1INCH puts the current point of control at $4 so it's a reasonably safe call to suggest that the price has found a relatively secure point of support on $4.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1a3j3r5cw1m61.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd19d4200ad3c6698bda70478f3c819438a54a64

1INCH sentiment is very high right now even with the conclusion of the stage 2 liquidity farming ending. This is a nice and positive sign that investors seem to be happy to hold their farming rewards to see what moves 1INCH will make, will it open a new round or will people want to cash in to move their liquidity elsewhere? So far, it seems farmers are happy to hold their rewards which for me, suggests a positive turn of events in that they want to see a higher price point to cash in more fully on their rewards.

No major changes on trading cap show that 1INCH is starting to be stable for a prolonged period, let's hope that this continues as 1INCH has been hit several times over the course of the past couple of weeks and those events have hurt the 1INCH price point.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w5u6mz6dw1m61.png?width=1679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fd84db9174846ebf27e8263750892fab32f2494

With the closing of stage 2 of the liquidity farming pools, the TVL value has shed over $1.1 billion and now sits at just over $300 million and this has had the knock-on effect of changing the M.Cap/TVL value to 1.6:1 which means that 1INCH is now a little over-valued as a project which is not the greatest of news but to see 1INCH back in under-valued territory only requires more attractive staking returns or the opening of a new stage of farming, either case would bring investors back to 1INCH but as it stands, 1INCH does need to choose a path and relatively soon.

The PSR has grown to 4:1 which continues to put 1INCH firmly in over-priced territory when talking about it as an asset. This is the biggest indicator that suggests we'll see small but constant pullbacks as 1INCH fights to gain traction on the price ladder and it is this that could potentially lock 1INCH in to a long-term consolidation. Ideally, we need 1INCH to stop their silence (currently two days) and come out with something that offers traders and investors the hope they are looking for.

Trade Channel Action - $3.4 to $4.52

Refined Action (Most likely)- $4.1 to $4.52

Confirmation of a breakdown is at $3.37 and a confirmation of continued price growth is at $4.83

Don't forget, if you are holding 1INCH for the long-term, consider staking them as 1INCH offer 3.29% APY on a 7 day flexible savings route via Binance. May as well earn some 1INCH whilst you wait eh?

Remember, I offer further reports via Pateon which now stands at 7 weekly reports which is 1 report per asset for the week ahead so if you would like to support my reporting, please come by [https://www.patreon.com/isce](https://www.patreon.com/isce)

However, I know that not everyone can fit this in to their budget but don't fret as this report will continue to be free on a daily basis and in this case, all I ask is that you try to ""pay the kindness forward"" where possible. Failure to do so may result in spontaneous combustion of a random appendage so it's well worth while trying to be kind where possible!
