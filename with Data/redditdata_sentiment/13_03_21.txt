I was always suffering from \_\_\_\_*(Pick up something that people can relate to (alcoholism, anxiety etc.)*\_\_\_ and nothing could help me.

Let's talk about the results and the new purchases!

First, let's see our profits or losses from worst to best! Each one had initially $1000 invested in them.

Coin Short | Profit/loss
-|-|-
BTRS |  -$134.33 
YUSRA | -$101.70 
ERG |  -$4.89 
COVER | +$85.92 
AUTO | +$112.48
ADK | +$136.90
ANY | +$274.49
BONDLY | +$307.01
FIO | +$348.09
QQQ | +$352.81
Total profit | $1376.78
Total to spend | $11376.78

3 coins made me a loss, with ERG only a tiny loss. 7 coins made me a profit, with 6 of them making a bigger profit than the biggest loss that was made. A total of 1376 profit was made which leaves me with over 11k to spend on this round! 

Some extra info: While those 10 coins made me a profit, the overal performance has been horrible. With the best coin being around the 330 rank last time, now the best one is at rank 433.  Four of the investments fell out of the top 500, and only one of those made me a loss. Many coins performed a whole lot better!

Now, let's name the next list of shitcoins! From the worst performer to the best worst performer. From almost 50% down to only about 17% down. Each coin getting $1137.68 of investment.

Coin Short | Amount bought
- | -
XEM | 2917.13
REV | 7584.53
MXX | 3346.18
MASK | 92.49
XLT | 446.15
EGG | 17.56
ZKS | 476.02 
BRG | 4550.72
XWC | 568.84
BMI | 419.49

Fewer from the top 400-500 this time, only 4 while it was 6/7 last time. And this time the worst entry is a top 100 coin! There's also far more small value coins with 4 being under $1, while last time that was only 1.

When you look up info about how to spot a scam coin, one of the things it tells you to look out for is...

###Signs of a scam coin

1. **""Unknown Group of Entrepreneurs are Running it""**

The Federal Reserve is run by a group of ""Unknown Private Investors""

2. **Whois lookup on one of their websites comes back anonymous or unavailable.**

WHOIS look up for UsMint .gov  tells me
""Information not available or no support for .gov""

3. **Shilling you to believe it's real by offering multiple periodic Airdrops**.

We're on our 3rd Stimulus now?

4. **Confusing whitepaper thats overwritten, and difficult to understand**

Anyone ever try to read, and understand Federal Reserve banking laws, or policies?
Some things can be understood but usually it's written almost entirely in Dog Latin, and you're going to need a lawyer to interpret that just like you'll need a fraud lawyer with crypto experience to go over that whitepaper when you're going after that scam coin to get your money back.  It's also INSANELY OVERWRITTEN.  The USD white paper will literally take you months to go over and understand. 

5. **GitHub Source has no supply limit set**(Devs can Mint coins)

Ahhh.... Nah, those private investors I don't know wouldn't want to do that. Besides, that would devalue the dollar, and severely hurt their credibility.

There is no tax obligation when you use your crypto's value this way - turns out if you never *sell* crypto, you don't owe taxes on it.

If you take out fully-secured loans against the value of your crypto (using it as 'digital asset collateral' - google it!), you owe no taxes on that money, and you have the right to come back for more cash (or to withdraw some of your crypto) if the value rises while you've got cash checked out.

I discovered this week that every time I used my on-paper crypto gains to secure a new investment loan, then spend it on business expansion (dedicated computer equipment in my case) I was actually reducing the amount of taxes I owed on my normal dayjob salary.


-----------------------

Here's a scenario: You make $10k a year, and you bought $1 worth of bitcoin. Time passes, and that $1 in BTC is now worth $200k. If you sell it, you're gonna owe a shitload of taxes.

Now, if you put $20k of your BTC into an account and pull out $12k cash against it, you can spend this money to buy yourself a new investment taxfree. Say you spend it to buy a restaurant. The restaurant pays out $1k before taxes come due.

Your taxable income for the year is now $10k + $1k - $12k = negative $1,000 in taxable income that year. Hello, tax return? Yes, plz.

Also, any interest you pay on that loan is a 'business expense' and further reduces how much tax you own on other profits that year.

This shit has changed my life, hope it helps some of you guys out too! 

-------------

This is the same method billion dollar corps use to constantly expand while owing little tax because they're ""operating at a loss"" due to tax deductions from using business expansion costs as a shield for their profits. 

Now, these tools are simply becoming available to regular people who can buy digital collateralizable assets $1 at a time, instead of needing to buy up deeds to land or yacht or other collateraliazble property first.

&amp;#x200B;

===GENERAL QUESTIONS===

Q: Is Celsius a bank?

A: NO, Celsius is not a bank. However, you can store either crypto or fiat currency (i.e. US dollars) in Celsius to earn interest rates &gt;6%. So in that way, Celsius acts similar functionally to a bank with superior returns. 

Q: Is Celsius profitable?

A: Yes, their business model is to give 80% of profit to depositors while retaining 20% for themselves. Because of this, Celsius adjusts interest rates for depositors as frequently as on a weekly basis. 

Q: How big is Celsius?

A: Celsius has the 2nd largest asset manager by AUM (assets under management) in the crypto space after GrayScale. - 

Q: Does Celsius have withdrawal fees?

A: No

Q: Why do other companies have withdrawal fees but Celsius doesn’t?

A: Celsius eats the cost of the withdrawal fees. That’s called customer service!

Q: Is there a limit on how often you can withdraw at Celsius?

A: Not currently (vs. BlockFi with 1 free withdrawal/month limit)

Q: Does Celsius mine Bitcoin?

A: Yes. Celsius has more hashpower from its mining operations than Riot, which is a publicly traded company valued at around $5 billion right now.

Q: Does Celsius loan out coins to short sellers?

A: In March 5th AMA, Alex said that Celsius doesn’t lend coins to directional traders (i.e. shorts) because that's where loss of funds occur, they only loan out coins to market makers

Q: Are all the CEL tokens distributed? Do they still need to be mined?

A: Yes, they’re all distributed already. 

Q: How much CEL does Celsius own?

A: Celsius holds about 270m tokens of the 695m. You can see the comprehensive breakdown here   

Q: Where’s the stats on Celsius users?

A: Here -  (REDACTED)

Q: Does Celsius work with Chainlink?

A: Yes, Celsius will use and support Chainlink’s Price Reference Data to calculate interest payment amounts to users. This will:

• exploit a decentralised, transparent and highly secure approach

• create a smart contract audit trail of its lending operations.

This will ensure that all Celsius interest payments will rely on the increased security of the decentralised network of independent – and security reviewed – Sybil-resistant Chainlink nodes. This means Celsius can move towards a new level of security and reliability which take advantage of Chainlink’s approach to decentralisation. -  

Q: How long has Celsius been around?

A: Since 2017 -  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

===SECURITY QUESTIONS===

Q: How healthy is Celsius? Can it survive a security breach?

A: Stats for Celsius as of Feb 12, 2021

\- 8.75b AUM (excluded California due to no lending licence); now updated on app &amp; website

\- 400k signups total, 18k last week

\- 327m gross transfers

\- 88m net deposits

\- 1m paid in promocodes last week

\- 5.8m paid in interest last week

Q: Celsius isn’t FDIC insured.

A: (1) FDIC insurance isn’t even big enough to cover the megabanks in the US from failing. (2) Celsius has $2 billion in reserves to a $10 billion AUM as of Feb 2021, while the Fed reserve requirement ratio for banks dropped to 0% during COVID-19, (3) several countries don’t have a FDIC insurance mechanism 

Q: Has Celsius been audited?

A: Yes, it was audited on Dec 2020 through Chainanalysis -   

Q: Does Celsius have insurance?

A: Celsius has insurance for its stored crypto, like most of its competitors. Problem is most of the coins on Celsius are loaned out at any given time, and no company has insurance on those coins right now. However, that’s mitigated by the fact that borrowers overcollateralize on Celsius. ALSO, YES Celsius IS coming out with opt-in insurance later in 2021.

Q: Who does Celsius custody with?

A: They use BitGo for coins in cold storage and Fireblocks for coins in hot wallets. See AMA here -  

Q: Can I trust the Celsius team? What’s their backgrounds?

A: Celsius puts security as a top priority--you can see this with app UI and withdrawal process that sacrifices convenience in order to mitigate user mistakes/hacks (users are often the weakest link and Celsius designs around this); a big, dedicated security team of Israeli cybersecurity professionals with an ""unlimited budget""; and the fact that Celsius has NEVER BEEN HACKED, unlike Ledger, Blockfi (), Nexus Mutual (), Binance (/)...the list goes on; and the use of Multiparty Computation (MPC) for securing funds internally (), which is the cutting edge of enterprise-grade encryption and security (). The fact that BlockFi got hacked on a SIM Swap is kinda shameful tbh. That's pretty much the 2nd thing everyone warns you about in crypto--don't use SMS based 2FA!!! (Note SMS based 2FA is not an option on the Celsius app)

Q: Is there like a technical architecture slide that shows the Celsius security stack?

A: Yes!  (URL Redacted)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

===TRANSACTION QUESTIONS===

Q: How does Celsius make money? It sounds too good to be true!

A: Celsius uses coins transferred by their customers as collateral for lending, rehypothecation, and other similar transactions. This works for a couple of reasons. (1) Celsius is one of the few organizations that accepts crypto as collateral, because JP Morgan certainly doesn’t. That enables Celsius to charge its borrowers a much higher interest rate than normally. 

Q: What if Bitcoin drops drastically?

A: Celsius overcollateralizes its loans.   

Q: Do you have proof that Celsius can survive a 50% Bitcoin drop?

A: In March 2020, Bitcoin dropped over 40% in a single day and Celsius was unaffected. 

Q: I have Bitcoin in my Celsius account, can I convert that to USDC or Ethereum?

A: Not yet, but in-app swaps are coming out later in 2021

Q: Can I connect my bank account to Celsius and buy Bitcoin directly?

A: Yes

Q: Can I buy crypto on Celsius through a credit card?

A: Yah but the fees are pretty high to do it that way so we recommend you fund your account in different ways

Q: What is CEL?

A: CEL is a “cryptocurrency” created by Celsius which sole purpose is to enable users to generate higher yield on their total portfolio if a certain % of their holdings are in the CEL token. For example, if I have a $10,000 account, and $3000 of that is in CEL token (with the rest in bitcoin), then my interest rate on Bitcoin would go up from 4% to 6%. This motivates users of Celsius to buy/hold the CEL token. 

Q: Is CEL the same thing as Celsius?

A: No. Celsius Network is the name of the company where you can deposit your crypto to earn interest. CEL is the name of a cryptocurrency token created by Celsius to assist with some of its mechanics.

Q: Can I buy CEL if I’m in the US?

A: No, Celsius considers CEL a security and only allows accredited investors to buy it. HOWEVER, you can buy most of the major cryptocurrencies (i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.) on Celsius. The SEC hasn’t officially ruled CEL a security, but Celsius is being cautious and following the law. If you make income &gt;$200k or have a net worth &gt;$1 million, you can buy CEL directly from the company by emailing them 

Q: Why can’t I buy CEL on exchanges? That’s sorta sketchy.

A: Alex has stated that Celsius doesn’t want to pay the exchange fees to list on Coinbase and other exchanges. With that said, you can buy CEL on BitFinex. 

Q: How can I buy CEL if I’m in the US then if I'm not rich?

A: You can use Uniswap or have an existing CEL user transfer CEL to your wallet.

Q: It’s taking me forever to transfer my USD to crypto, how long does this normally take???

A: Normally it takes 7 complete days at minimum, and can take a couple weeks max. It’s annoying, especially for new crypto users who aren’t use to / don’t know how long transactions can take.

Q: Is there a fee for buying crypto with Celsius? 

A: You pay in the spread, which is about 1%.

Q: Is there a fee for transferring crypto to Celsius?

A: You pay the gas fee for ERC-20 tokens (Ethereum-based tokens)

Q: How can I buy CEL if I’m NOT in the US?

A: Liquid, BitFinex, FTX, Uniswap

Q: Does Celsius participate in DeFi activity with our deposited coins?

A: Yes

This is not advice, just person observation.

* Polygon (MATIC coin) already has adoption - polkadot too.
* Polygon can do what Polkadot can do and more via alternative L2 options for Ethereum
* Polygon has ALL of the developer environment and tools of Ethereum - polkadot leans on Ethereum too, but not quiet the same transferability. Polygon has a clear advantage here.
* Polygon has the security of Ethereum as well as reach to Ethereum-based projects that want scalability-Polkadot does NOT have that.
* Polygon's development was supported by TWO **competing** highest-profile exchanges, Coinbase (ventures) and Binance, which is uncommon
* Polygon (MATIC) is trading on Coinbase before Polkadot, an attribute of due diligence

It seem the Polygon is better situated as a hub for the ""internet of blockchains"" than Polkadot. Again, I like both projects a great deal, and this sector of blockchains is likely to become huge with room for both. **But the current marketcap of these two projects makes little sense to me**.

At the time of this post, Polkadot marketcap is &gt;$30 billion, while MATIC (polygon) is &lt;3 billion, greater than a order of magnitude difference, &gt;10X. I do not see the logic in this.

The public as well as businesses are looking for a way to pay and spend their cryptocurrencies and it is bringing a lot of interests and players from unlikely places. So here is a quick list and my opinions on them.

Bitcoin / Ethereum - While they are widely accepted and valid for big item purchases, most stay away due to high fees and and slow transactions. You would finish your coffee before paying for it sadly.

Stablecoin - While its the most ""natural"" of transitions, most are Ethereum ERC-20's, the transaction speed and gas fees are an issue.

Ripple / Stellar - Both with the same aim but different ways of getting about it. If the foreign exchange markets can teach us anything is that high speed and low fees are crucial in making trades happen.

Nano / Banano - Fast and feeless is amazing but acceptance is what's hindering its adoption as there are few locations one can spend them. Once this is overcome however...

Litecoin / Doge - Joint mining means fast and cheap transactions and being a first generation crypto also means plenty of infrastructure available. The trouble is the acceptance of merchants as well as the public to use them as a currency.

Monero - Privacy is very important, but while it's not really slow, it may not be fast enough...

If you don't have these coins in your phone wallet as a way to pay for small ticket purchases, consider it. Create a crypto exchange amongst friends for meals. Don't shun paying for someone else's lunch if that offers an opportunity to diversify your holdings. 

Are there any other coins I have missed out on?

There have been lots of scams with people selling Ledgers already initialized with pre-loaded 24 word pass phrases.

If you must go that route, be sure to reset the device as soon as it arrives to generate a new phrase. (Probably a good idea to do, anyway and I'll tell you why later.)

You should have to create your own PIN. If you don't have to do that, your device was tampered with.

The device should come with a blank card to write your phrase on. If it comes with a card that has 24 words on it already, it was tampered with.

The reason it is a good idea to rest your device anyway after setting it up (assuming it is legit) is that it is a good way to test your 24 word phrase.

So you want to do this:

1 - Set up your device.

2 - Make note of some of the addresses of some cryptos. (You can also send a very small amount of crypto that you don't mind losing to an address on the device)

3 - Reset the device by putting in the wrong PIN three times.

4 - Use your 24 word phrase to restore the device.

5 - If the addresses are the same/the tiny amount of crypto you sent is still there that means you've written your 24 word phrase down properly. If not, you made a mistake somewhere.

(As you can probably tell, the reason that you want to confirm you've written your phrase down properly asap is because you don't want to load the device with lots of valuable crypto only to find out when you need to restore it that you wrote the phrase down wrong when you first got it.)

Alternately, you could get a second device (as a backup) and then attempt to restore that with the phrase from the first one. That way you wouldn't have to reset the original.

Are there any workarounds for the high gas fees that Ethereum has right now? Even though the money I invest isn’t going to break me if I loose it I much rather preffer to have it in my own wallet. 
Oh and currently I only know of the gas fee indicator on Coingeko.

A lot of the time, the things like this that are disliked, but somehow seem to always work, are not \*really\* disliked by the community at large. Clickbait titles, as long as they're not outright lies, are difficult to get around.

LinusTechTips has talked about this in the past - Linus goes into detail about why many of their thumbnails and titles are so clickbaity in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiV8eXJgzys) (it's long), and another LTT staff member wrote about it [here on Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/agmgj9/can_we_please_stop_the_click_baiting/ee7x9e4/).

I hate the obvious sensationalism too, but it works. And you could have, for example, the best damn DD in the world, but if you gave it an ""accurate"" title with zero sensationalism, nobody would click on it.

I'd compare it to ""everyday low price"" strategies that some major retailers have tried out. [JCPenny famously fired their CEO](https://nytimes.com/2013/04/14/business/for-penney-a-tough-lesson-in-shopper-psychology.html) after it resulted in a major reduction in sales, and the same thing happened when places like Macy's and Walmart tried this strategy.

Yeah, I think the constant raising of prices and then having ""sales"" all of the time is pretty silly and manipulative, but collectively, we still like the illusion of getting a good deal. Even people who know that manipulative sales strategies aren't saving them any money often end up voting for them with their wallet.

And it's the same with clickbait. Many of us say we hate it, but we still tend to click on that content rather than the content we say we prefer. It seems more like we hate the idea of clickbait than clickbait itself."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1891620|public|self|Unpopular opinion: Clickbaity titles like this are necessary|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m3y1jc/unpopular_opinion_clickbaity_titles_like_this_are/|all_ads|6|1615585995.0|FOCUSED-DISCUSSION||FOCUSED-DISCUSSION|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Vh9dVHZ9ItvMX8zYuwIfattlFhDArxsOPsY-4ri3Wmc', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xygPyrrKdRvhxPKt1QdoZy3AqyL653-C3KRNrz2IAy8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b848cc1e33fcef01b33baa16efbb99a3b3af0109', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xygPyrrKdRvhxPKt1QdoZy3AqyL653-C3KRNrz2IAy8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90d54d3bacd5d9048e93da86f8dd2541e1d6c6ca', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xygPyrrKdRvhxPKt1QdoZy3AqyL653-C3KRNrz2IAy8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=953783112492a090c6414a5a70579b912a3d1b3a', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xygPyrrKdRvhxPKt1QdoZy3AqyL653-C3KRNrz2IAy8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=22f7ff0f7a73cc7a8f9862dc375bf442f866a9e0', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||2021-03-13 03:23:15+00:00|t3_m3y1jc|0|0|0.28||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||13_03_21|03_21|0.09452483|0.46864405|0.43683112|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.035742782056331635|0.11643794178962708|0.013254957273602486|0.7067638635635376|0.11938688904047012|0.008413459174335003

Or if I had taken out a loan of 10k back when I was thinking about it, I'd have this much now. But my past self didn't know how things would play out. No one does. 

So instead, I look at the charts and ask myself, If I take out 10k loan right now and ask myself, where should I put that 10k now for it to be more in the future.... I don't know.

So instead, every paycheck, I take out anywhere from 25$ to 25%... what ever I can afford... and put it in crypto. It's gotten to a point where my Crypto portfolio is now rivaling my 401k that i've been building for the last 4 years with my company's matching program.

So Even if there are ups and downs, I keep buying. For example. I bought at the beginning of this week, then multiple projects have dropped anywhere from 5 to 20% and it's ok. I'll keep an eye on things, but I keep telling myself that time in the market is better than timing the market.

My dad approached me because he has friends who were talking about it. I told him I recommend only a 5% allocation because he’s almost retired and only has a tiny pension. He wanted to YOLO 10% but I said no... I explained that this is not a get rich quick scheme or a gamble.

Completely innocent ""squeaky clean"" people who use cryptos with transparent blockchains have often have no control or knowledge of exactly who they are transacting with. They can easily trade or receive coins that are connected to ""shady"" people or deals. Any innocent people caught up in this may be forced to fight to prove and maintain their clean reputation. Why risk having to go through that?

Critics used to laugh at /100trillionUSD for predicting that Bitcoin would be worth $288k by the end of next year. Many of your friends probably scoffed at you when you told them Bitcoin's fair value should be at least $50k.

Bitcoin broke $60K for the first time (and hopefully the last time ;D).

Some look at All Time Highs as the perfect time to take profits.

The thinking goes:  

1. Time the market by selling at the ATH
2. Let the price fall as other people sell to take profits thereby tanking the price 
3. Then buy more stocks or coins at that cheaper price to end up with more gains than if you just bought and HODLed through the ATH price correction

The problem with that is your timing has to be pretty good all the time. Just one or two bad trades and you can get rekt. More than one trader has been ruined by this line of thinking ever since stocks and bonds were invented. 

It's called ""outhinking the market"" and is a common trap for many investors, both new and veteran traders alike. You can't deny that massive gains \*can\* be made from Technical Analysis - that S2F model is scarily accurate - but no model is 100% accurate and one Black Swan event - especially combined with leveraged trading - can sometimes lead to massive losses.

Is such a thing possible? Is there enough wealth in the world to make such a thing happen?  What would that even look like?

Well, let's run some quick math and take a look:

----

# The Million Dollar Bitcoin

- A *million dollar* Bitcoin would make Bitcoin's market cap of 21 Million total Bitcoins worth $21,000,000,000,000, or 21 Trillion USD.

- If we assume a BTC Dominance which remains at about 60%, this would make the entire Crypto Market worth 35 Trillion Dollars.

- The Current US Stock market has a total value of about 51 Trillion Dollars, as of December 31st, 2020 ([Source](https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/)).

- This would put the entire Cryptocurrency Market Space at approximately 69% the value of the US Stock Market; this would be an increase of roughly 17x from the Cryptocurrency market's almost 2 Trillion Dollar current value.

So, turns out, a *one-million dollar Bitcoin* is actually numerically rather possible, and within the realm of reality given a long enough time frame.

----

# Theoretical Maximums?

But let's go farther.  What other *huge numbers* would be theoretically possible for Bitcoin.  What would it look like if Cryptocurrency actually became the currency/base of value in the 21st century?

( The following examples keep the 60% BTC Dominance rate, for the purposes of math. )

- If Crypto grows to the size of the entire 2020 US Stock market, one Bitcoin would have a price of $1,451,671.67 ( Almost 1.5 Million Dollars )

- If Crypto grows to the size of all stock markets in the world of 2020 (~90 Trillion), one Bitcoin would be worth $2,571,428.57 ( About 2.5 Million Dollars )

- If Crypto grows to the size of all ""money"" assets in the world of 2020 (~215 Trillion), one Bitcoin would be worth $6,142,857.14 ( A little over 6 Million Dollars )

- If Crypto somehow subsumed all value of all assets in the world of 2020, at high end estimates ( 1.2 Quadrillion USD ), one Bitcoin would be worth $34,286,714.28  ( A little over 34 Million Dollars )

( [Source on worldwide money valuations](https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/13497643/how-much-money-in-the-world/) )

Oh, and one last fun one:

- Bitcoin 'only' has to grow to ~300,000 USD per Bitcoin in order to be worth more in market cap than the entire global banking industry of 2020.

---

#Closing Thoughts

A Million Dollar BTC is honestly a lot more ""realistic"" than I expected, with the entire crypto space not even overtaking Wall Street in value unless BTC Dominance dropped immensely.

However, on the other hand, once you reach closer to the magical One Million Dollar mark, there's really very little room for the Crypto Market cap to grow beyond that ( comparatively ), and it would very likely represent the last 'order of magnitude' growth BTC would see, outside of fiat inflationary reasons.  In short, returns would likely look much more like traditional stocks at that point.

In a slightly more grounded reality, however, it seems very likely that the current ~50-100K bracket for BTC will be the last 'jumping off point' to still see any potential for 10x returns on BTC itself (and even that represents *massive* adoption for BTC as an asset overall).  Once the price starts climbing into the $100-200k+ range, there's just not enough money sloshing around in the world of investments to see insane gains anymore."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1895527|public|self|So what is the theoretical maximum value of Bitcoin?

Banano    started suffering from payout issues with their F@H bot around a week    or so ago. Now this is no problem, this stuff can always happen. They    blamed the F@H api for this saying it couldn't handle the amount of  new   users folding (banano had went into a bullrun). For days they  stated   that it was solely the F@H api limiting them and that they were  looking   into different ways of getting the data.

*(not    sure if this is true) a user pointed out that F@H was willing to work    with the banano team to fix their issues but the banano team never    reached out to them.*

Now, a    couple days ago a developer announced he sold 1M of his banano at    banano's ATH (\~$23k). And to me this is where it just gets a bit shady.

Developer    sells his banano but they aren't giving any clear reason as to why  the   payouts aren't working. A lot of older F@H users are getting their    payouts on time and like normal.

Now this post [https://np.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/m3yys2/i\_made\_a\_web\_scraper\_for\_foldinghome\_to\_maybe/gqsaaru/](https://www.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/m3yys2/i_made_a_web_scraper_for_foldinghome_to_maybe/gqsaaru/) proves that it isn't actually a F@H API issue rather the banano bot not being able to handle the payouts.

To    me, if the banano bot didn't work as normal then why don't the devs    just tell us upfront. Seems a bit easy shifting the blame on F@H and    then just not fixing the issue.

They will attract consumers by offering discounts on their products when bought with their own currency -Buying a Macbook? cheaper if you pay in Apple coin- 

This will be the when Cryptocurrencies start to become a more wanted/valued currency than fiat and entire ecosystems start to get built around a currency. If you're using several Apple services, it makes sense to get a discount over serval products, this keeps their consumer base within their ecosystem and it will make it easier for them to push you their newer products ""Apple healthcare"".

They will likely create their own blockchain and not rely on a 3rd party (smaller businesses will be the ones on the Ethereum and Cardano networks, there will be websites similar to ""website builders"" such as ""Wix"" that will assist you getting your business on a 'chain).

Personally I believe they are waiting for a better formula/algorithm stablecoin to exist, or more insight into how ""safe"" a store of value (BTC) is. Everything still being based off fiat makes the Apple coin more risky for them as they will want to cash our their profits from Apple coin into something non fiat.

The one that stands out to me the absolute most is HBAR(Hedera Hashgraph).

This is not a shill post, or a pump post, this is meant to be a serious discussion on the space and the tech. From my understanding Hedera Hashgraph is similar in functionality to block chain, but it seems to have already solved a lot of problems that some of these larger and more prominent coins are currently facing using Hashgraph tech instead of block chain tech. Fees never inflate, transaction speeds are ridiculously fast and accurate. There's a lot that just stands out. At least that's what I see from my understanding of how all this tech works and what the end goal is. Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong about any of this because I'm always trying to gain perspective and understanding.

This project is involved with very large, well known companies such as Google, IBM, Boeing, etc. I rarely see any posts about it, or people talking about it on youtube. I came across it by accident, but once I started following up on what it was I'm having a hard time understanding why it seems there's not really much attention on it. 

Could it be because it's not block chain, or because they aren't actively trying to advertise it, or is it in a phase like bitcoin was when it was first really talked about?

I just feel like I'm missing a puzzle piece. If these huge companies weren't involved, aight I would see why there's no traction/attention on it, but there are some really large names attached.

&amp;#x200B;

I was buying sketchy shit online, and they only took Bitcoin as a payment. So after hassling through making a wallet and funding it I had to wait 5 days to send the funds(It was a credit card used to buy the bitcoin, so there was a hold for fraud reasons)

&amp;#x200B;

During that time it had gained like 6%, and I actually paused at the checkout thinking I should have just loaded up more cash, that's a wicked cool return for a less than a week. The next day I was looking through posts and graphs of Bitcoins rise and falls over the years, and the following week after that had made a plan to DCA put into it every month.

And subsequent comments ‘there’s no way BTC could have a market cap of $z when the money supply is $q’.

The major flaw in logic here is assuming that market cap is roughly representative of how much actual money is in the system. For example, I decide to start COIN blockchain and I issue 10m tokens. If literally one person buys one token off me for $1, boom the market cap is $10m even though there is only $1 actually invested.

This is of course true of any asset given how market cap is calculated, but crypto is quite different in that (in the case of BTC at least) the vast majority of coins are illiquid and coins mined in the early days cost almost nothing. For example Satoshi would have $60b of the market cap and these coins are possibly lost forever. 

My point with all of this rambling is at the end of the day, the market caps of Bitcoin and other cryptos are theoretically infinite due to the low amount of coins actually traded, and so the maximum prices of these coins are anyone’s guess."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1896849|public|self|The flawed assumption with market cap|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m4g6us/the_flawed_assumption_with_market_cap/|all_ads|6|1615651999.0|TRADING||TRADING|||||||||||2021-03-13 21:43:19+00:00|t3_m4g6us|0|11|0.71||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||13_03_21|03_21|0.1058338|0.4481893|0.44597685|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.06887347251176834|0.13158805668354034|0.01260214764624834|0.5141336917877197|0.26247766613960266|0.010325027629733086

If I were to Invest $100 in to 50 start up altcoins, 49 could fail, and if 1 goes 100x I will have doubled my money. That is just for perspective.

This is actually a feasible strategy given that there are only a limited number of altcoin start ups. This is comparable to buying extremely cheap options on many stocks and having 1/100 hit and make a profit.

Just because Reef got an investment does not make it a legit project. The amount of red flags are staggering on it. I do not want anyone to loose money, I hope we all make it and get rich. This is not “FUD” this is just me trying to tell you to be careful. (Side rant: calling all differing opinions FUD is a big trend on reddit this year, that term was almost never used 2 years ago).

EIP 1559 should be implemented by July this year which will add deflationary pressure to the network.  Vitalik &amp; Team have decided to go full ahead with early implementation of PoS without sharding which could happen anytime. This would completely remove miners' from the equation and the so called crypto haters won't even have this argument that ETH requires a lot of energy to run, and is not good for the environment.

Moreover, NFT's are gaining a lot of traction and with increased transaction speed, the problems with high gas price will also reduce, with more reduction with sharding next year. I have a haunch that Ethereum is going to go parabolic from here.

BTC is already 3x from it's last ATH, however, ETH has only seen a 35% uptick from its last ATH.

https://www.ltonetwork.com/

Apparently they say:
Top 15 blockchains worldwide.
100k+ daily transactions.
90+ nodes (avg 30 days).
60+ ecosystem partners.

LTO Network is a hybrid blockchain for securing, verifying and exchanging business critical information.

Apparently a top blockchain in EU. They seem to focus on business and integrating blockchain seamlessly into existing processes. They don’t believe in disruptive as it costs too much for businesses to implement - instead they merge with existing processes and save businesses millions of dollars which is why they have so many partners and working use cases.

They also work with government and one huge thing is they are GDPR compliant..?! That’s huge.. 

Has anyone heard of LTO? Seems to me it could be 1-3 billion market cap which is 5-20x its current market cap or potentially more.
Great tokenomics and team.

Their vision:
https://blog.ltonetwork.com/blockchain-trends-2020-vision/

Interesting in depth research report: 
https://blog.ltonetwork.com/hodl-research-report/

Can we get some discussion on this before I go all in... Seems like perfect timing for this bull run, and it’s already getting started. I don’t want to miss out :/

Past change:
7 days: +46%
14 days: +85.0%
30 days: +74.8% 
1y: +1852.4%

Seems like a lot of potential at only 0.147 bil market cap.
Pls do some research and let me know what you think before I go all in on this coin.

Imagine all those loyalty points that you accrue at your most frequented supermarket or shop. Now imagine if, instead of arbitrary points with zero translatable value those points were tokenised; existing on the blockchain and tradeable via DEX? If there was a supermarket that did something like that I would be all over it. It would make for such a brilliant and interesting customer loyalty scheme.

IMO there could also be so many interesting directions to go in. For example they could be built upon something like the Tendermint platform and be interoperable with other loyalty/employee benefit schemes within the parent company. They could maybe utilise staking benefits for all kinds of interesting purposes too, letting loyal customers gain interest on points for validating transactions etc. 

I believe these are the kind of everyday usages which may be all too common in the future.

I saw that co founder of YouTube and Alexis from reddit are part of the team

I decided to try out the software. Apart from the issue of not being about to change the font easily - man I was blown away. I make quick e-commerce stores all the time as well as more elaborate ones 

The pain with making a quick e commerce store is you still have to go through the hoops for Spotify and it’s $$$ 

This is such a brilliant alternative. And it takes crypto and CC and PayPal. 

Even if this wasn’t a coin, I would be invested in this company as a business owner somehow. It will be strong competition to eBay/Etsy/shopify in the next 5 years

As for a coin well I’m not sure but I bought a bit of it. Will feel it out over the next week if I buy more 

I’ve already used my pop up store to make some sales (I threw some skincare products I wanted to sell off instead of using Mercari saved my self the fees) and I’m highly impressed 

The issue would have to be protection but it offers no less than a Spotify store but not as much as an Etsy store (for returns etc)

I’ve studied graphs and I have a reasonable understanding of candles

I’ve got a reasonable chunk of cash in crypto to invest not trade. But I figured I’d throw $250 onto Binance margin account

Took a while to get my head around OCO orders but I figured it out

So my first trade was a Long order X2 (borrowed 2 lots of my initial investment)

So I set a stop limit at 58950 which was 3.5% lower from where I started so I guess I stand to lose 10.5% of my initial investment if my stop loss order is hit 

Am I correct in that assumption?

And I’ve set my Price at 65000 I’m starting to think that might be too high it could take a few days to achieve that and I pay interest on the borrowed assets 

But anyway that’s my first trade I figured now might be a good time to go long on your first trade when we are in price discovery!

I actually wanted to ask... if I decide to close the trade early I simply cancel the orders right?

And I’ll get the profits from my original stake and from the two borrowed assets?

That being said, which currencies will benefit from this the most? Is it only ETH? Or are there different applications across multiple different blockchain technolgoeis?

Specifically when it relates to BTC hasn’t moved in 2 days etc etc and just ignoring the 3 digit gains this year. I’m not entirely sure what I’m referring too. 

I’m bored of checking prices all the time, I’m bored of checking this sub all the time. 

I’m “making money” from the gains and even that isn’t really making me lose my mind.

Don’t get me wrong, in Jan I was religiously checking and losing my mind at how much money was being made. 

I put this down to spending the last few years just meh due to riding the previous 2017/2018 bull up and back down.

I’m bored of the moon farming, I’m bored of useless input to this sub. I guess I’m like I am with my index fund. I check it once a month just to note down net-worth and that’s it.

And you know what, it’s a FUCKING great place to be. I’m ambivalent right now and that’s a lovely place to be. Being to heavily emotionally involved is taxing and takes up so much precious time. 

Once I broke even and had taken profit for the first time in 4+ years, I really just let go of the emotional side and now I just check in very occasionally over the past few weeks. 

I used to open the charts like people open social media, and it was fucking ridiculous. I had muscle memory to open my phone and the app and check even if it wasn’t what I wanted.

When the bubble pops and the bear market comes the first things to fall will be the biggest gainers of the bull market: Tesla, SPACs, and—you guessed it—Bitcoin/crypto. People will rush to real estate, commodities, and precious metals. Green energy stocks may also gain if Biden can get green infrastructure legislation passed. 

Maybe some specific crypto projects like Monero will be ok as black markets tend to thrive during recession."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1895492|public|self|They know stagflation is coming...|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m4c8i2/they_know_stagflation_is_coming/|all_ads|6|1615640597.0|FOCUSED-DISCUSSION||FOCUSED-DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-03-13 18:33:17+00:00|t3_m4c8i2|0|14|0.75||1||[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 80, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Everything is better with a good hug', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': 0, 'icon_format': 'PNG', 'icon_height': 2048, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png', 'icon_width': 2048, 'id': 'award_8352bdff-3e03-4189-8a08-82501dd8f835', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Hugz', 'penny_donate': 0, 'penny_price': 0, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73a23bf7f08b633508dedf457f2704c522b94a04', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50f2f16e71d2929e3d7275060af3ad6b851dbfb1', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca487311563425e195699a4d7e4c57a98cbfde8b', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b4eedcffb1c09a826e7837532c52979760f1d2b', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4d5ab237eb71a9f02bb3bf9ad5ee43741918d6c', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69997ace3ef4ffc099b81d774c2c8f1530602875', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9519d1999ef9dce5c8a9f59369cb92f52d95319', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f076c6434fb2d2f9075991810fd845c40fa73fc6', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85527145e0c4b754306a30df29e584fd16187636', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8843cdf82c3b741d7af057c14076dcd2621e811', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png', 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}]|False|True|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||13_03_21|03_21|0.1058338|0.4481893|0.44597685|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.06887347251176834|0.13158805668354034|0.01260214764624834|0.5141336917877197|0.26247766613960266|0.010325027629733086

I've recently seen an uptick in posts voicing concern about Binance US. My current diversification is having crypto stored on Kucoin, BinanceUS, Coinbase Pro, and a Ledger Nano X. 

I have been using Binance US for depositing and withdrawing to/from USD, but with the recent negativity toward Binance, I wanted to give Kucoin a chance. I bought a small amount using my debit card, and I've been waiting what seems to be way too long for even a confirmation email. With Binance, my deposit and withdraw experience has always been very fast. Confirmation emails are sent quickly, too.

My question is this: Since the only way you can buy crypto is with (to my limited knowledge) centralized currency, (US dollar, CAD, etc..) doesn’t kinda defeat the purpose of it being an independent currency?
Like shouldn’t you be able to exchange something else for crypto? I don’t know, I know this is super dumb but I figured I’d ask anyway"|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|379410|public|self|I have a dumb question|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/m3xt4u/i_have_a_dumb_question/|all_ads|6|1615585129.0|discussion|d990f59a-aa4d-11e3-bb1c-12313d053130||||||||||||2021-03-13 03:08:49+00:00|t3_m3xt4u|0|1|0.67||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||||||||||||||||||13_03_21|03_21|0.11373047|0.41845116|0.46781844|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.04209398850798607|0.06655336916446686|0.0036040658596903086|0.8177513480186462|0.06688778847455978|0.0031094748992472887

Let's get down to it shall we?

Well, here we are again, back at $4 after a couple of days moving through yet another pullback to below $4.

As you can see on my chart, the consolidation is on-going as the price action trades firmly within the trade zone I've laid out weeks ago but despite another drop below $4 this week, we can see that the price action has respected my lower linear price line which is really, the only positive news I have at this point...what a sorry state of affairs that is....

Before I go any further, let me give you the run-down on the next four days with regards to where the price needs to stay above.

Today - $3.71

14/03/2021 - $3.79

15/03/2021 - $3.81

16/03/2021 - $3.9

Any moves that stay below the prices listed will result in a correction with regards to the long term price projection which will see the estimation lowered.

On slightly positive news, the price action has once again moved above the Bollinger Band Median line whilst the Bollinger Band channel continues it's constriction as the price continues to consolidate. This type of constriction is indicative of a breakdown or breakout that may happen over the coming week and as much as I prey to the crypto-gods everyday that 1INCH has some really traction, it will be good to see if my piety pays off or if I will be damned to the realm of continued consolidation purgatory.

As it stands, my linear price projection lines give an estimate of breaking out of consolidation by April 4th 2021 the latest so it could be that 1INCH continues consolidation for another month...yay....SAID NO ONE EVER!

The depth chart puts the buyer to seller ratio at 3.1:1 with sellers in overall control but buyers are actually holding the advantage at the current active price point which, if buyers can hold the line, will keep the price firmly at $4.09 over the rest of this weekend.

My outlook at this point would suggest, if you are interested in accumulation, dropping out of 1INCH now and coming back in at $3.8 which is the most likely move during next week.

Sentiment continues to remain relatively high but 1INCH are gambling with the goodwill of the traders and investors out there and if they don't start exploiting the fiscal value of their token soon then I am going to expect that sentiment to start to decrease down towards 70% over the course of the coming week.

The spreadsheet data is still pretty disappointing.

The M.Cap/TVL ratio is at 5.2:1 which puts 1INCH in over-valued territory, this is largely because of the complete lack of confirmation on whether 1INCH intends to exploit liquidity farming on the BSC side of it's operations or attract new long-term investors in to staking pools with higher than average APY .

The longer this issue goes on where 1INCH does not move one way or the other with regards to forward planning on the investment front, the larger the risk becomes of 1INCH becoming a second rate DEX in comparison to it's competitors. Yes I know that 1INCH's primary strength is in being an Aggregator but 1INCH need to fully exploit and develop both avenues.

The PSR is not much better as this sits at 4.6:1 which puts the token in over-priced territory and with the way that the token has been lacking appeal to traders and investors alike, it would seem that I have to concur that the price of 1INCH is over-priced which could impact the price dipping and staying below $4. If this is the case then I would expect to see a confirmation of this in the coming week at the latest.

Overall, 1INCH is starting to stagnate and lose it's shine. As a fellow reddit user said, the metal unicorn is losing it's shine and losing ground to the pink unicorn. I really do have to agree with this despite my wanting to be a 1INCH fanboy on the grounds of the fundamentals.

In summary:

Expected Trade Activity: $3.38 to $4.53

Realistic Trade Activity: $3.5 to $4.2

Long-term projection still holding at $17 (apologies on yesterday's typo).

Before I sign off, I have a few other titbits to share with you.

Firstly, anyone catch the most recent 1INCH Tweet linking to the collateral onboarding application on maker forum?  1INCH has been giving the story that TVL rose to $1.5 billion without any mention of it now standing at $100 million. My question to 1INCH is why have you omitted the full dataset? This seems rather deliberate in my opinion as the post was last edited yesterday!

Funnily enough, 1INCH also included in their Tweet the following:

""We are waiting for your likes, shares and questions relating to 1INCH"", yet here I am, asking question after question and getting no response, NONE! This is not acceptable as it is breaking your covenant  with your supporters.

To my readers, am I mad? Am I wrong?

Here is the link to their post - [https://forum.makerdao.com/t/1inch-collateral-onboarding-application/6960](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/1inch-collateral-onboarding-application/6960)

Also, don't forget that 1INCH now has their own official subreddit on r/1inch_exchange and as for Monday, I'll be moving over and releasing my daily reports there rather than here so do make sure to join me there to share our collective opinions with 1INCH.

Lastly, time for me to plug my Patreon by letting you all know that I have just released my week long forecast for Chainlink so if you like my reporting here and want to see all my other reports for the other assets, please feel free to pop by my Patreon at [https://www.patreon.com/isce](https://www.patreon.com/isce) as your support means I can keep writing!

If you can't stretch to supporting me on Patreon, no worries, just remember to pay the kindness forward as these reports continue to remain free on a daily basis.

We can always benefit from showing a little bit of love to each other from time to time!

Anyway, have a good weekend all and I hope you all continue to KEEP IT GREEN!"|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|379847|public|https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6qXI4yJWGqD6ZmxpEWJ8o_uN76DfjEI4Ymp4sSI_yww.jpg|1inch Daily Analysis -
