-Since 2/18/20, I have posted a crypto/asset of the day for discussion.  I typically begin by posting the current price, as well as the brief CoinMarketCap summary. If there is a video featuring it on Coin Bureau, I also post that. After a week or so, I usually post replies to some of the posts, and I also add an overall summary of my thoughts, if I plan to hold any, and is so how much. 

-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=author%3Ajoenorwood77&amp;restrict_sr=on

-My first month or so I featured projects listed on some of the main exchanges. Now I plan to focus on the top 100 on CoinMarketCap. After that I expect to broaden to the top 200, and then some random moonshots. I will eventually create a post looking for any projects I should feature before I eventually close this project.

-Just because I feature a project does not mean I like it. I feel discussion on bad projects are just as important as the good ones. It is useful to hear pros and cons about every project, even if you are simply playing devils advocate.

-I would say a perfect reply would include at least one pro and at least one con for the project. However, I still feel it is acceptable if you post only pros or cons. If your post does not have any substance to it, ""this coin is a scam"", ""avoid this shitcoin"", ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"", then I will just assume you are posting for personal gain rather than helping the community.  If you simply downvote the post without any comments, the only thing you accomplish is having less people view the post. I do not care about Reddit Karma, but if a post drops to zero early on, it can be extremely difficult for people to even find these discussions (which I assume is your intention). 

-These posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion. Everyone is responsible for doing their own research. For each project, I am interested in learning if you have any investment in it, and if so, about what percentage of your portfolio does it carry. Most importantly, what should we all know; good, bad, and indifferent, about this project? "|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|992481|public|self|Discussion of the Day: Tron TRX|0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/fvobit/discussion_of_the_day_tron_trx/|all_ads|6|1586111596.0||||||||||||||2020-04-06 00:03:16+00:00|t3_fvobit|0|8|0.63||

Would Nucoin be identical to bitcoin when it comes to coding? Or would it have it's own system that makes it decentralized, and therefore worthy of its investors' faith?

How would people mine Nucoin? Are rigs that mine bitcoin capable of mining other currencies as well, even of they are brand new? Like, if Nucoin was released today could a bitcoin rig immediately start earning it?

I dont appreciate getting treated like a criminal for trying to help my DYING father out. The man just lost his wife the day after christmas due to cancer and less then a month ago he had another heart attack killing 25% more of his heart. Through this all he has for income is social security at 1,500 a month. I moved up here from LA to help him with his ranch and the animals along with the finances. when I moved here we both got sick with pneumonia and he just got out of the hospital from that. Plus with the corona virus bs my entire county is on lockdown inside there homes so I cant go to work here. So, I sold my car and tried to invest in to monero so I could take advantage of the current volatile currency market (hopefully) and help him pay the mortgage that has already passed on his beautiful house just had just finished building with everything he has worked for AND his wife had worked for. You guys called me and treated up both like criminals for using your service and take our money? Then have an attitude when we are confused why and not helping us one bit, still keeping the money without a further word!!! I am not USING anybodies information, IT IS MY DYING 73 YEAR OLD FATHER FOR GOD SAKES have a friggin heart you monsters. YOU are the criminals we have done nothing wrong except trusting you with our livelihood.  I am going to post this incident all over social media and contact my father lawyer if you dont just HELP ME! How heartless can you be do you really NEED our little bit of money that bad you would do such a thing?

YOU SEE WHY?????? You kept yelling at me and my father asking why like its any of your business  what we do with our money. I can back up any verify EVERYTHING I have said including why I want to invest into monero and how every single day you hold my money you are killing us. Look at a recent chart of monero and even a 3 year old could figure out why I want to invest in it.
Its gone up 45% in 14 days 5% every single day, Im not stupid or a criminal Im just poor and under some odd circumstantial hard times. Please dont make it worse for us then it all has been and is, People will have a field day with this story on social media and boycott your company I can guarantee that much. All this is just beyond me how anybody could be so misunderstanding and cold hearted.

Reputation (REP) is the backbone of the Augur ecosystem, a decentralized prediction market protocol built on the Ethereum platform. REP can be thought of as a utility token for the broader Augur protocol, which helps users speculate on the outcome of events such as sports, polls, and weather.

With a total addressable market that includes betting and gambling, is Augur primed to be one of the most disruptive applications of blockchain technology? Or, with a steep learning curve and limited active users, will Augur struggle to gain traction? We encourage you to develop your own opinion. This report walks you through the fundamentals of Augur's utility token REP: [https://cryptoeq.io/coreReports/rep-abridged](https://cryptoeq.io/coreReports/rep-abridged)

***From the report:***

**REP Strengths**

* An early and well-known ICO leveraging Ethereum technology and network effects
* Reputable and [active](https://github.com/AugurProject) development [team](https://messari.io/organization/forecast-foundation) which continues to iterate on the product
* High ceiling and lots of room to grow due to the potential users/total addressable market of a prediction market (gambling, sports betting, esports, political polls, weather, etc...)
* Very little active competition in the cryptocurrency prediction market space

**REP Weaknesses**

* Insignificant adoption and [active users](https://coinfomania.com/178-4m-market-cap-augur-rep-only-115-users/), niche use case
* Even with [v2 upgrade](https://medium.com/@AugurProject/augur-v2-details-2547bbfc3c1f), the learning curve is steep as users must be knowledgeable about and comfortable using Ether, DAI, and REP
* Potential markets like gambling, assassination markets, etc... operate in a gray zone and will undoubtedly face scrutiny from governments

Smart contracts are the fuel of the Ethereum Ecosystem. Everything on the Ethereum ecosystem is initiated through smart contracts. Written on Solidity, [Ethereum Smart contracts](https://www.somish.com/blockchain/ethereum-audit/) are self-executing with specific instructions embedded in code that gets triggered when certain conditions are met.

Any discussion regarding the importance of auditing Ethereum Smart contracts will not be complete without the mention of DAO hack that resulted in the loss of $750 million as of July’19.

The current state of the auditing sector suffers through the supply and demand problem. The supply of knowledgeable developers who can find vulnerabilities in the code is low and the demand for proper auditors is high. This results in prices going through the roof and yet the desirable results not being delivered."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|992626|public|self|Ethereum Audit|0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/fvty21/ethereum_audit/|all_ads|6|1586136478.0||||||||||||||2020-04-06 06:57:58+00:00|t3_fvty21|0|1|1.0||

I'm considering investing and becoming a Masternode for Wienchain. They are attempting to become blockchain for project incubation. They have an interesting proposal system where companies and projects can apply for funding that is paid out from block rewards. And they seem to already be partnered up with a shopping mall in Bangkok. I just want to do my due diligence before investing. Has anyone heard of Wienchain? Does anyone know of a similar project? 

Thanks in advance :)
