For those chasing some TA strategy this probably isn’t useful, but if you’re just trying to throw some of your paycheck in regularly, might be relevant.

TL:DR - DCAing on the 1st of every month was a decent strategy for 2021

Here is what the average buy price would have been depending on your DCA strategy (the lower the average buy price, the more BTC you ended up with)

Sundays - 47,333.5
Mondays - 47,373
Tuesdays - 47,075.1
Wednesdays - 47,011.3
Thursdays - 46,936.4
Fridays - 47,239.3
Saturdays - 47,121

All that is to say, if you’re DCAing weekly, Thursday would have been the best day, but with only a roughly 1% difference between the best and worst day.

It’s a bit different if you look at it for day of the month. There’s definitely a bell curve shape peaking at the 16th. If you’d DCA’d every 16th of the month your average buy price would have been 49,874, where as the first of every month would have been 45,314, with the 26-29th all being in the high 45s too. But with a definite uptick for the last day of the month.

Comparing weekly v monthly DCA - seems like you would have been better off sticking with monthly.

Going further, if you were trying to chase the dips, and try to “DCA the dip” - there’s obviously a lot of different strategies here, one I mapped was DCAing in every day that BTC was 20% or more lower than it’s recent ATH. This meant buying a little in Feb, March, may, then almost everyday from mid may to early October, then starting again during the recent dip. If you did this your average buy price would have been 41,651. So better than monthly DCAing, but only by about 10%. For the control you give up with this strategy (you don’t know how many days are going to be &gt;20% down), 10% seems like a small premium.

Do what you will with that info, hopefully my new found tableau skills got the math right."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4218824|public|self|2021 DCAing - By the Numbers|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rrnjg6/2021_dcaing_by_the_numbers/|all_ads|6|1640804611.0|STRATEGY|8f527258-dc39-11eb-b1ee-0eae9aa8a335|STRATEGY|||||||||||2021-12-30 00:33:31+00:00|t3_rrnjg6|0|3|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||30_12_21|12_21|0.07180818|0.4595531|0.4686387|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.11978783458471298|0.24547013640403748|0.03017503023147583|0.39705783128738403|0.18479794263839722|0.022711189463734627

yeah. its part of it. 

its worse today than ive seen this whole year, but its an overwhelming majority of people complaining about the current price action.

and yes im aware that the people who still use the daily thread to talk about price action are very fallible anyway, but still. 

the bull run might be over. lets take a look back, btc did a 10x from its early 2020 prices, eth did almost a 50x from its early 2020 prices. lifechanging money for anyone who was in it. just like anyone who was in btc or eth before 2017 experienced life changing gains. 

yes, it may not be over. it might be another dip. whatever. 

it shouldnt matter. if it matters, youre in too deep, and you should pull a chunk out in case it gets worse. 

“but moon tomorrow ill miss aths!!”

cap. you wont miss anything. it might flicker back up, but itll flicker back down. if you take what youve over invested, reinvest into anything more stable, even if its just yourself, and steadily dca back in, worst case scenario, you miss out on a little bit of gains over that time period, but youre not freaking out or putting yourself in financial jeopardy. 

if youre over invested, youre gambling. 

if youre not over invested, it doesnt matter what it does before the eoy. its a win win. in fact, its better for it to go down rn, so you can hold and dca big bags from the ground up. 

eth only 5x’d from its previous bull run ath. itll probably do less from this peak to next peak. but it did 50x from its low point to its peak. if it goes down and you can buy a stupid amount of it or any crypto you believe in, youll be retired in 10 years easy which I KNOW, its not the get rich promise youve heard from this sub but damnit man 10 years to retirement is still insane if you think about it. 

just chill out or pull some out. the lottery ticket chance of aths tomorrow is not worth the stress youre causing yourself."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4219019|public|self|the daily thread today is pathetic|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rroe0d/the_daily_thread_today_is_pathetic/|all_ads|6|1640806947.0|ADVICE|e9570888-9c2a-11e3-809c-12313d1661cc|ADVICE|||||||||||2021-12-30 01:12:27+00:00|t3_rroe0d|0|11|0.71||1||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||30_12_21|12_21|0.13241875|0.48861924|0.378962|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.06887347251176834|0.13158805668354034|0.01260214764624834|0.5141336917877197|0.26247766613960266|0.010325027629733086

The dot com bubble was a result of excessive speculation on internet related companies. As is well known, the bubble burst once it became apparent that a lot of these companies were running out of money, etc.

Obviously comparisons are being made here by MSM and others with investing into crypto. For shitcoins this comparison might be fair. Also for USDT and whatever is backing it up. However, for solid projects surely the better comparison is domain name registration? Are those of us who are putting money into btc, eth and other solid projects not equivalent to those lucky individuals who reserved domain names in the early 90s, an activity better know as domain name squatting. Therefore, purchase the domain name, and then sell it later at a profit when some company or individual desperately wants it. This activity was / is highly profitable to those who hodl (and unlike with crypto actually comes with an annual cost in order to keep the domain).

That is its greatest use-case. In the future every website, every app will have a send/swap function to give a coin here, accept a different coin in return. Think about being on discord now and how many steps it would take to send crypto to someone you see there? In the future that will all be erased (think blogging photos vs instagram). In the future it will take one step, just like in real life. There will be a dex swap function on every www site, integrated by whatever blockchain the site chooses, ie blockchain wars. This will also mean the integration of username and crypto address (happening now as almost novelty, but will be normal in the future, and anyone sharing a hex address will be a dinosaur).
Irl every shop or store will have crypto and dex swap payment facilitated by a blockchain handler. Visa, Amex, legacy banking are dying before our very eyes. 
Once a major website integrates then every smartphone will add its own wallet. What do you think will happen to the blockchain that Apple chooses as its dex?

Hi guys. I’m currently writing this on my microwave because I just bought my 69420th dip this year. I just sold my left kidney and this microwave is all I have left. I’ve got it plugged into my portable USB-M port charger and it’s running on low battery so I’ll make this quick. I’ve got nothing left. I’ve bought so many dips that I am in fact naked whilst writing this I had to sell all my clothes because of this last dip. My dip buying addiction has got so bad that I’m in fact now living in a dumpster. It really doesn’t actually smell as bad as you’d think. I’ve kind of gotten used to it. In fact I’d rather have that last bit of ETH I just bought than an actual house because in 2022 it will defo go back up. In fact speaking of dips I actually got a free dip in this dumpster, too. Half a packet of macky’s smokey bbq sauce. I’m thinking of selling it for 0.05 CRO. Anyways let me get back on topic - It started like any other addiction - I first spent all my fiat money on it. All my savings, dip after dip, were no more - and the worst part? It just kept dipping. So I bought the dip again. Once I was out of fiat money, i began to sell screenshotted NFTs. It worked for a while but then i sold my phone so I couldn’t screenshot anymore and this microwave doesn’t have that as a feature yet. Maybe in the next update. So I sold a few of my possessions - first it was nothing major - just some stuff I could get by without. The toaster, then my espresso machine. But then it kept dipping. I need to DCA… but to DCA I need to… buy the dip… so I sold my dog. Then I sold my wife. Then the house. But it just kept dipping. And now, I sit here, typing this on my microwave with 2% battery, one kidney left and my bare wang getting so damn freezing that I think it’s about to drop off. Happy new year guys and remember - you don’t need two kidneys to function. Always prioritise buying the dip."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4219366|public|self|Buying the dip|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rrpwpa/buying_the_dip/|all_ads|6|1640811276.0|REMINDER|f8383538-5cd9-11e8-b037-0e5fb51a12ae|REMINDER|||||||||||2021-12-30 02:24:36+00:00|t3_rrpwpa|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||30_12_21|12_21|0.12868376|0.4246554|0.44666085|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.1379556953907013|0.35149896144866943|0.01769876293838024|0.2853624224662781|0.1942172795534134|0.013266895897686481

For me I have 3 coins which I think will do a nice and colorful firework in 2022:

Harmony ONE - growing ecosystem, big and promising roadmap, fast transaction speeds

Elrond - better than SOL, ONE and ETH if you can believe the stats of this coin

Cosmos ATOM - could become the center of all blockchains because Cosmos tries to connect all blockchains together. A blockchain of blockchains which will make transactions between blockchains possible and more!

I just wondering if there is any tool where I can find the most volatile crypto in the past months/weeks.

Also if I could select the mainnet, I mean ETH, BSC....

So is there any tool for that?

I think it could be an interesting thing to check the most volatile crypto to trading this or at least to study the crypto to trading.

If there is not a tool, just is there any tool to filter cryptos in market cap, price... etc?

Think about those three words, they are purely emotional, they aren't about facts or logic. If you were to describe yourself, are they the adjectives you would like to use?  Is that how you see yourself, a cowering fearful little person, who cannot make up their mind?

No, of course not, and you are not those things.  You got into crypto early and so you have a decent amount of risk taking bravado, and daring-do.  But still even the most certain among us has those points of weakness, those moments where the crypto-warrior gives way, just for a moment, to the less certain ""could it all go to zero"" mentality.

As I am saying, that moment passes, we remember the strong fundamentals of our crypto-vision, we are here to do important work, to change the world to a more egalitarian one; the little people can rise up and bank ourselves!  Phew, we are back, we are strong!

But then that FUD post flies in, you are drawn to it like a moth to a flame, perhaps it connects to your existing bias, perhaps it is contrary to your beliefs, but either way, its designed to have an impact on you.  It plants that seed, that maybe, just maybe, there is a problem.  You wipe your brow, and the sweat has diluted your crypto war-paint a little, you see it on your hand.  This is almost impossible to avoid, humans have whats called negative-bias, we place more importance on negative news than positive news.  FUDsters know this, this is how they seek to manipulate you.

You see crypto is a movement, we are all here fighting the existing legacy power system, but a (block)chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  Every FUD post/comment, is an attempt to weaken your resolve.  It doesnt matter if your bags are in project X or Y, and whether that FUD seems to immediately help or hinder your personal cause, its hurting crypto, and its trying to manipulate you.

How many people here think about exit strategies back to fiat?  Its FUD that causes that mentality, if you really think crypto is worth your time and money, why on earth are you ever going back to fiat?  

FUD, thats why.

So the next time you see that FUD post or comment about crypto on general, or a specific project, down-vote it to oblivion; make sure another person isn't infected with their stupid nonsense claims.  Spreading FUD isnt clever, its the absolute lowest form of communication.

Good luck and stay strong."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4221449|public|self|The reasons behind FUD, and how it impacts you.

In my country theres a negative interest of 1% on anything over a certain amount, on top of the inflation it feels like my pile is slowly being eaten by rats. With that in mind, seeing these +10% APY on stable coins offered, it's of course extremely tempting to take that route.

However seeing all the BS around Tether especially has turned me off. Im wondering how you all view stable coins and these seemingly too good to be true aPY's in the long term. 

Unlike the fiat I put into crypto, this isnt something I can afford to lose. And setting some of the funds in doesnt really make sense, as the APY paid out would hardly make a difference (plus why would I risk anything at all if I dont believe in it). It feels like an all or nothing thing to me, so just wondering what you's thoughts are on the subject.

It is time for me to commit to crypto. The last year I have been following and trading (without success). Now it is time to have a strategy. The last month I have been doing some research and looking into various ways of investing in crypto. Some more successful then others of course. But I found one thing important. The strategy has to fit your personality. How well you can handle losing and how committed you can be in time and money.

I must say reading a lot of posts about research people did and different strategies helped me a lot!

On forehand, I already was quite biased towards a DCA strategy. The reason for that is that at the moment there is no room for a Lump Sum investment. I do recon that if you have the funds and betting on the all over growth of the crypto market, Lump Sum is the way to go and probably combine this with a form of DCA.

Back to my strategy. I have been thinking how risk tolerant I am and must say quite tolerant (I am very willing to commit to crypto) but not extremely (so not to bet on low cap gems/shitcoins). So what do you do then. I wanted to take advantage of ""The Dip""and I also want the risk control of DCA. So I'm combining the two.

\- Deposit a fixed amount of cash into exchanges;

\- Use 80% of this to DCA weekly into the Top 5 Market Cap every Tuesday on 1 p.m. CET.

\- Keep 20% cash on the exchange for Dip Buying;

\- Immediately staking all the coins in the exchange (In it for the long run);

Now when do I buy the dip. Based on the last couple of months I found a 8% drop in 24h a significant enough of a Dip to buy. So every 8% drop I buy in addition to my weekly DCA.

Now the investment horizon. I was looking at a minimum of 5 years. Why the 5 years you might ask? Well I would really want to complete a full Bear and Bull market to take full advantage.

So this will be my journey.

Wil the payouts automatically add to the total amount staked? Example: 1000 ada staked, after payout will it stay 1000 ada and 5 ada is added to my spot account or would i now have a staked amount of 1005 ada? 

Also, do i have the option to payout in fiat (eur)? And if so, does that go for all tokens eligible for staking?

Only thing im unsure about is staking the ETH due to it being locked until 2.0 and we dont know when that will happen, right?

If you have it on an exchange, GET IT OFF at least for just that day.  (Honestly, though, unless you are actively trading your crypto, you shouldn't have it on an exchange anyway.)

It is ***EXTREMELY*** important to do this as it shows centralized exchanges that they don't own your coins.  (If you don't do this, then essentially that DO own your coins.)

Now, I certainly understand if transfer fees would make taking your crypto off of exchanges prohibitive, but other than that I do highly suggest in participating in this yearly event.

You can clearly see how fast things were moving this year, compared to previous years. I still believe we are early but this movement is crazy.   


Obviously Reddit doesn't show everything but an increase like this shows that crypto is getting closer to mass adoption every second and more people are getting interested, especially seeing this exponential growth.

I am few months into crypto and tried to accumulate information about it from as many sources as possible, but i just cannot get past one aspect of crypto, more specifically farming, which is impermanent loss. 

You pair, for example, 100$ worth of BNB gets paired with 100$ worth of Token X and you start providing liquidity for that pool. Now let’s say Token X goes up in price while BNB stays around the same. After retrieving the liquidity, if you were to convert the 100$ of BNB to Token X, you can buy less of Token X with your BNB since Token X is now up in price. But. Here comes my noobish curiosities.

If Token X actually goes down in price instead of going up, and still BNB stays around the same, wouldn’t that mean that you can now convert your 100$ of BNB to more of Token X? And wouldn’t that mean that If Token X bounces back after being down, you would be more profitable than in a loss? (assuming that you converted your BNB when you had the chance). 

And. Also. If BNB goes up, wouldn’t that also be good for you? (Assuming in this case that Token X paired with BNB stays around the same).

Appreciate everybody’s time and effort in advance, grateful for any knowledge provided."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4224470|public|self|Impermanent Loss|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rsbefq/impermanent_loss/|all_ads|6|1640876499.0|DEBATE|5b762856-d7c9-11e4-822a-22000b2300b2|DEBATE|||||||||||2021-12-30 20:31:39+00:00|t3_rsbefq|0|3|0.8||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||30_12_21|12_21|0.11373047|0.41845116|0.46781844|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.04209398850798607|0.06655336916446686|0.0036040658596903086|0.8177513480186462|0.06688778847455978|0.0031094748992472887

It's one of the biggest for OHM DeFi forks. 

There are two main strategies for market participants: staking and minting. 

Stakers stake their PEPE tokens in return for more PEPE tokens, while minters provide LP tokens or MIM tokens in exchange for discounted PEPE tokens after a fixed vesting period. 

It's a great way to get more PEPE, you don't need to buy more, you can just stake or mint. 

PEPE is a decentralised reserve meme currency protocol built on the Avalanche network. 

It's the first one meme OHM fork. 

Website- [https://pepedao.finance/](https://pepedao.finance/) 

You can get PEPE now on TraderJoe and stake on PepeDAO website. You will get 1:1 sPEPE for your PEPE. Rebase for stacked PEPE is every 8 hours.

Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of Pepe DAO. 

Stakers stake their PEPE tokens on Pepe DAO website to earn rebase rewards. 

The rebase rewards come from the proceed from bond sales, and can vary based on the number of PEPE staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy. 

Check complete guide docs if you don't get it yet, it's the deal. We have extreme opportunity, it has just started now. 

It's always the best to get into DAO at early stage."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4225381|public|self|First meme DAO ever to exist.

For those chasing some TA strategy this probably isn’t useful, but if you’re just trying to throw some of your paycheck in regularly, might be relevant.

TL:DR - DCAing on the 1st of every month was a decent strategy for 2021

Here is what the average buy price would have been depending on your DCA strategy (the lower the average buy price, the more BTC you ended up with)

Sundays - 47,333.5
Mondays - 47,373
Tuesdays - 47,075.1
Wednesdays - 47,011.3
Thursdays - 46,936.4
Fridays - 47,239.3
Saturdays - 47,121

All that is to say, if you’re DCAing weekly, Thursday would have been the best day, but with only a roughly 1% difference between the best and worst day.

It’s a bit different if you look at it for day of the month. There’s definitely a bell curve shape peaking at the 16th. If you’d DCA’d every 16th of the month your average buy price would have been 49,874, where as the first of every month would have been 45,314, with the 26-29th all being in the high 45s too. But with a definite uptick for the last day of the month.

Comparing weekly v monthly DCA - seems like you would have been better off sticking with monthly.

Going further, if you were trying to chase the dips, and try to “DCA the dip” - there’s obviously a lot of different strategies here, one I mapped was DCAing in every day that BTC was 20% or more lower than it’s recent ATH. This meant buying a little in Feb, March, may, then almost everyday from mid may to early October, then starting again during the recent dip. If you did this your average buy price would have been 41,651. So better than monthly DCAing, but only by about 10%. For the control you give up with this strategy (you don’t know how many days are going to be &gt;20% down), 10% seems like a small premium.

Do what you will with that info, hopefully my new found tableau skills got the math right."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4225027|public|self|2021 DCA - By the Numbers|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rse0ei/2021_dca_by_the_numbers/|all_ads|6|1640883294.0|STRATEGY|8f527258-dc39-11eb-b1ee-0eae9aa8a335|STRATEGY|||||||||||2021-12-30 22:24:54+00:00|t3_rse0ei|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||new||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||30_12_21|12_21|0.07180818|0.4595531|0.4686387|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.11978783458471298|0.24547013640403748|0.03017503023147583|0.39705783128738403|0.18479794263839722|0.022711189463734627

This is maybe good for a short-term pump! So maybe a coin to put on your watching list for the next days.

Similar to Bitcoin, Ravencoin halves the block reward every  **2,100,000 blocks.** Since a block is generated about every minute, it is halved about every 4 years. Ravencoin halves will continue to occur every 2,100,000 blocks until the reward can no longer be halved. 

The current Ravencoin block reward is 5,000 RVN. After halving in January 2022, the block reward will be halved **from 5,000 RVN to 2,500 RVN.**

Conventional FIAT currencies allow governments or banks to print money and cause inflation. In the case of Ravencoin, the total **supply is** exhausted to **21,000,000,000 RVN** . Printing extra money leads to inflation. Unless additional money is being printed, the value of Ravencoin should increase as demand increases (more people will be using Ravencoin) and supply decreases or remains unchanged (Ravencoins will no longer be ""printed"").

If you want to know more:

# How many days is 2,100,000 blocks?

2,100,000 blocks = 1458.33333 days @ 1 minute blocks

# What is that in years?

1458.33333 / 365.25 = 3.992699 years (with one leap year)

# How accurate are those timelines

This is all dependent on the number of blocks, not calendar time. If the block speed is faster than one minute, it will be sooner. If slower, it will be longer than 3 years.

No financial advice. Since there is a pump each halving, I would say there is a big chance to get one there... But make what you want with your money!

Imagine being able in the past to get passive income with www domains. 

Now this will be possible with Custom Wallet Addresses for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Litecoin and Dogecoin Chains.

VNY utilise a techique called ""Split Key Generation"", utilising the customer’s Public Key, will output a string of code called Partial Private Key which will be used by the customer to create the New KeyPair for the new address. VNY Team will never have access to any wallet.

That's big, but what follows after big marketing is even bigger Vanity VNETWORK, dyor.

Mercor disrupts the financial industry by democratizing the world of algorithmic trading. Algorithmic trading is investing through algorithms. Trading algorithms/bots are pre-programmed trading strategies that perform buy- and sell orders automatically. In other words, these algorithms do the trading for you. And chances are likely, they do it better! Why? Because trading algorithms are able to trade 24/7. Imagine all the profits you miss out on during your sleep, at work, on vacation and so on. With an active trading bot, the trading keeps ongoing, improving the chances of great returns. 

We all know not to trade with emotions. Good thing algorithms don’t have any. They don’t have bad days and are ever consistent. 

These are just some of the many other benefits of algorithmic trading. 

Oftentimes, getting green results is all about timing and speed. Algorithms can perform trades with timing and speed humans could never match. This is one of the many great benefits of Mercor in algorithmic trading.


Mercor makes algorithmic trading accessible for anyone. On the Mercor platform, there is a developer environment, where talented developers and hedge funds are able to create and deploy trading strategies. So, if you’re a developer, you are able to do so too. You will set your own profit fee and can start earning! 

On the other side, there is the investor environment. This is where investors/traders can pick an algorithm to their liking and invest in it by a few simple clicks. Once invested, the bot will trade your funds automatically and investors can join all the benefits of algorithmic trading. This way, Mercor provides a passive way of earning for its users.

&amp;#x200B;

Cryptocurrency ATMs are a popular way to buy or cash out bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, bypassing the traditional banking system. In September, the total number of cryptocurrency ATMs worldwide reached 10,000, 67 percent more than a year ago. The sector is growing rapidly and is not going to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

What is a cryptocurrency ATM and why do you need one

A cryptocurrency ATM (crypto-machine, or BTM, which stands for Bitcoin Teller Machine) is a device that allows buying or cashing in bitcoins (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Dash (DASH), Litecoin (LTC) and others. Instead of a bank card, it uses a crypto wallet from which coins are debited or sent to.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Cryptomats are primarily just a convenient way to instantly exchange cryptocurrency for cash without dancing with tambourine. They are most popular among users who don't have constant access to high-speed Internet, and also among those who don't have a bank account or don't want to have one for privacy reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

How the sector is developing

The first crypto machine was installed in October 2013 at a Waves coffee shop in downtown Vancouver, Canada. According to Coin ATM Radar, in September 2020, the number of cryptomats worldwide exceeded 10,000. A year ago there were only 6,000; at the beginning of the summer there were 8,000. In just one year, their number has increased by 67%. And although compared to more than 3.5 million conventional ATMs it is like a drop in the ocean - the trend itself is important. The sector is actively growing and shows no signs of slowing down. As cryptocurrencies grow in popularity and confidence in them increases, there are more and more crypto machines.

&amp;#x200B;

Most crypto machines are in the U.S. (7,800 - 127% more than a year ago), Canada (812 units) and the U.K. (260 units). Crypto machines are also popular in developing countries and countries with unstable financial markets. The demand for the service in the Latin American, Asian and Australian markets is also growing rapidly. In total, crypto machines are installed in 71 countries. Russia currently has 51 cryptomats, Ukraine has 23, and Kazakhstan has 3.

&amp;#x200B;

In total, there are more than four dozen manufacturers of cryptocurrency ATMs. Genesis Coin (35% market share) and General Bytes (30% market share) produce the most devices, as well as Lamassu, BitAccess, Coinsourse. They operate slightly differently, but we won't go into details - there usually aren't many cryptomats around to choose from anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Regulation of crypto machines: how they are treated by authorities around the world

Cryptocurrency ATMs allow you to buy and sell digital currencies and convert them to cash. Anything related to cash is the domain of bank regulators, so they can't leave cryptocurrencies out. Therefore, in countries where cryptocurrencies are permitted and regulated, crypto operators must comply with anti-money laundering legislation. In the U.S., for example, they must comply with the same standards as banks: register with the Federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as well as obtain a state license. In Canada they have to report all transactions over 10,000 Canadian dollars (about $7400). The authorities often accuse cryptocurrencies of being used by criminals to hide their profits. In reality, criminals launder about $1-3 billion through cryptocurrencies and $0.8-2 trillion through banks and cash. Thus, no more than 0.3-1% of all digital assets are used for criminal purposes."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|691381|public|self|Cryptocurrency ATMs: how they work and why they are needed|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rs5zyb/cryptocurrency_atms_how_they_work_and_why_they/|all_ads|6|1640862673.0|altcoin|d01b99d2-ab3f-11e3-a25a-12313d21b86e|NEW COIN|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'by3d7tws8czkJUqU0QZ8xlndvmUK16H44d2KAOprX_M', 'resolutions': [{'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iT0ZG2qV0SQaDnNr1cd94bWPxfgAD6J0hiCCNduVn7Y.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82cdf64bd42a2646611d729237cbfc16e1f7f518', 'width': 108}, {'height': 243, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iT0ZG2qV0SQaDnNr1cd94bWPxfgAD6J0hiCCNduVn7Y.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=126e4126e366b2f57f7977f97fc201a0a86a0ff1', 'width': 216}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iT0ZG2qV0SQaDnNr1cd94bWPxfgAD6J0hiCCNduVn7Y.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dc27fb6e387da63ffa975c79ea82b2f544ca28d', 'width': 320}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iT0ZG2qV0SQaDnNr1cd94bWPxfgAD6J0hiCCNduVn7Y.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=125d89faf31bf04d5c072d3f8c678ef86cd90c16', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 788, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iT0ZG2qV0SQaDnNr1cd94bWPxfgAD6J0hiCCNduVn7Y.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=29c4df9e6abaff7591994d6b313c0d1e1c553cbb', 'width': 700}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||2021-12-30 16:41:13+00:00|t3_rs5zyb|0|4|1.0||1||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||30_12_21|12_21|0.11076456|0.4499968|0.43923864|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07071885466575623|0.20293867588043213|0.01466779038310051|0.2337827980518341|0.4597536027431488|0.018138350918889046

**TLDR**:Uniswap allows traders to swap tokens easily and earn passive income by participating as liquidity providers. The user interface is easy to use, and making trades is only a few clicks away.Uniswap is using “constant product” to swap any pair ERC-20 token, but it has a disadvantage such as a slippage when the market fluctuates strongly and a lack of liquidity on one-side occurs. Besides, Uniswap has some risks such as front running, token risk, smart contract risk and impermanent loss.$UNI token is used for 2 main purposes: governance and reward for providing liquidity. In particular, providing liquidity is very limited, and only pools approved by the community through governance can receive $UNI tokens. At the time of writing the report, providing liquidity programs have ended.Uniswap may not completely replace traditional exchange or DEX due to its unsuitability for performing large volume trades. In the V3 update, some issues are solved by the core team, in which choosing the range price to provide liquidity can be considered as a big improvement. Besides, the L2 solution is also provided by Uniswap to reduce expensive costs on the Ethereum mainchain.It seems the enhancements are not designed to increase incentives for UNI except for governance as in previous versions. ***Do you think this is an omission of Uniswap?*** 

# General Conclusion

Uniswap is an Ethereum-based decentralised exchange (DEX), where people can trade between with ERC-20 tokens entirely on-chain using smart contracts. It eliminates order books and is an interesting feature compared to centralised exchanges (DEXs).

&gt;Check out how it works here.

The main innovations from the Uniswap protocol are the development of a user-friendly platform on which traders can easily swap tokens. While at the same time, enabling anyone who becomes a provider of liquidity and passively earns transaction fees.Although only more than 2 years of development, Uniswap has had a certain success. It is a bootstrap for projects further promoted, has strong development potential and at the same time faces many new challenges. In this report, we will analyse in-depth the economic aspect and understand how it works.

# Introduction

## What is Uniswap and How Does It Work?

Uniswap is an Automated Market Maker (AMM). It allows users to swap any ERC20 token, using the liquidity pool instead of the order book.Uniswap is a 100% decentralised and permissionless protocol, operating on the following formula: x \* y = k (called “constant product”).

I’m expecting blockchain games to have the most investments, especially with the Metaverse being the hottest topic for the past 3 month. 

Meaning we’ll be witnessing the rise of projects like Citrus that aims to accelerate the transformation of gaming and provide solutions to the blockchain world by introducing next-gen DeFi ecosystem, valuable NFTs, user-friendly DApps and beyond. 

And of course platforms like Vault12 that’s protecting crypto users by minimizing risks through its Personal Digital Asset Security that allows users to recover, backup and provide legacy inheritance for all their digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFTs, other cryptocurrencies, private keys, seed phrases, digital art, and their crypto wallets."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|691504|public|self|The level of investments in Blockchain will be insane in 2022|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rsawcf/the_level_of_investments_in_blockchain_will_be/|all_ads|6|1640875203.0|discussion|d990f59a-aa4d-11e3-bb1c-12313d053130|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-12-30 20:10:03+00:00|t3_rsawcf|0|1|0.6||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||30_12_21|12_21|0.1058338|0.4481893|0.44597685|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.06887347251176834|0.13158805668354034|0.01260214764624834|0.5141336917877197|0.26247766613960266|0.010325027629733086

This is not financial advice.

  
**TLDR**:Both protocols serve in a potentially thriving derivatives market. Despite the common goal, the product architectures of the two protocols are vastly different.Perpetual Protocol provides star delivery contracts using vAMM Mechanism along with a Funding Rate. Especially when the trader is also LPer for their own position. This gives them higher leverage.Kashi is similar to a lending protocol but includes loan scalability features. That is, instead of mortgaging and getting a loan and mortgaging to get a new one, Kashi has integrated them into a single transaction. However, since the target collateral utilisation is 70-80%, the maximum leverage is quite low, theoretically x3, and Kashi offers x2 as the largest.

# General Conclusion

We shared about DEXes before. They are decentralised exchanges to allow for users to trade. The current popular assets being traded are assets at spot prices. A new improvement to that is margin trading. Margin trading is where you can trade more than the value of your asset. For example, you get to trade 10x the value of the asset that you have. Adding margin trading with DEX model is innovative and that is what we want to focus on today.Margin trading is a small category in DeFi Space. Although this niche does not have too many projects, there are outstanding projects: Kashi (from Sushiswap), dYdX, Perpetual Protocol, and so on.We recently shared about another perpetual swap mechanism in DeFi. Perpetual Swap had become the first product built on-chain for the derivatives market to achieve impressive trading volume numbers. In this article, we share two points about Margin DEX:

* Why Margin DEXes were born
* The difference between 2 DeFi derivatives Protocols

# What Problem Does Margin DEX Solve?

When you trade on centralised exchanges (CEX), you will connect the market through an intermediary (exchange), your money will be managed by the exchange (custodial) whether you want it or not. Because of such a centralised model, CEX exchanges are often the top target for hackers to attack.Even the Top CEXs in the industry have been hacked, so I don't think the problem is ""was this exchange hacked or not?"" but ""when?"". In addition to security issues, the CEX exchange also has problems related to user fraud.Margin DEX was created to solve most of the above problems:

* Trustless: Users have access to the marketplace without the need for an intermediary.
* Non-Custodial: Users will be able to control and manage their own assets and do not need to deposit them with any party.
* Transparency: Everything will be operated through Smart Contract on Ethereum and managed by DAO in the future.
* Permissionless: Anyone, anywhere or at any time can access and use the platform of Perpetual Protocol without restricting permissions by anyone.

# Perpetual Protocol

Perpetual Protocol is a protocol that allows the issuance of perpetual futures contracts of any asset. The goal of Perpetual Protocol is to decentralise futures contracts, allowing anyone, anywhere, anytime to access and use the platform for trading without going through 3rd part.The core of the Perpetual Protocol is the project's protocol, which consists of two main parts:

* Virtual Automated Market Makers (Virtual AMMs): A virtual automated market maker (vAMM) model inspired by Uniswap. *Note: PerpProtocol is looking to move away from VAMM model.*
* Liquidity Reserve: Liquidity Reserve as collateral for Virtual AMMs.

# Kashi

This part details how Kashi works, and how it brings revolutionary innovation to L1. We want to explain the tie-up between BentoBox and its upcoming Dapps, including Kashi. BentoBox is a vault, acting as a decentralised “App Store”, where you can deposit assets inside to activate other Dapps.As such, Kashi is a Dapp developed on BentoBox, a margin trading platform backed by its lending protocol that allows users to create lending token pairs of varying degrees, however, they assume that profits can be maximised."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|691607|public|self|DEX With Margin Functions: Perpertual Protocol &amp; Kashi|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rsfwcl/dex_with_margin_functions_perpertual_protocol/|all_ads|6|1640888456.0|discussion|d990f59a-aa4d-11e3-bb1c-12313d053130|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-12-30 23:50:56+00:00|t3_rsfwcl|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||30_12_21|12_21|0.06340579|0.49510497|0.44148928|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.08904828876256943|0.15009088814258575|0.0093326261267066|0.4671396017074585|0.2762399911880493|0.008148635737597942

But let’s focus on NFT related developments and Polygon Studios that had an insane year, starting with raw statistics: over 750k wallets holding Polygon NFTs, more than 10k new NFT collections minted on Polygon, $2.5 billion in NFT trading volume, 15 billion total assets minted on the Polygon blockchain.

During Q1, Digitalax fashion NFTs sold for $171k, launch of a native minter to help bring NFTs mainstream, Kings of Leon release “When You See Yourself” album as NFTs on Yellowheart, Jack Dorsey mints and sells his first ever Tweet as NFTs for $2.9mn via CENT, Elon Musk mints and sells Tweet as NFTs for $1.1mn via CENT. 

Moving to Q2, First audio NFTs launch on Polygon, Ember Sword conducts first land sale using Polygon, Opensea integrates Polygon, Blind boxes launch on Polygon, NFT volume using MATIC hits 700k on Opensea. 

In Q3, Neon District NFTs launch, MATIC NFT volume reaches 17 million on Opensea, New York Knicks NFTs launched with Sweet.io, NFT vol spikes to 40 million, UNXD drop Dolce &amp; Gabbana fashion NFTs, Rario launches on Polygon Studios, Burger King “Keep It Real” Meal NFTs with Sweet.io. 

And finally during Q4, Amitabh Bachchan NFTs launch on Polygon Studios, Derace launches on Polygon Studios, DraftKings partners with Polygon Studios, Unstoppable Domains moves to Polygon Studios, Ticketmaster uses Polygon for NFL ticket NFTs, Stephen Curry drops his 3-pt record NFTs, and much more.
