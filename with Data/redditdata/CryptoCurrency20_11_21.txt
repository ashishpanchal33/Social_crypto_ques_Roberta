What does this mean, at least from my point of view. This it's just proof that crypto, it's putting the Fiat system to the test, and it's making noise to the people who have a huge stake at the current status quo of the financial structure that societies have been under, over decades now.

And why is that? Why does crypto, and in my opinion specially Bitcoin, can disrupt so abruptly. It's mainly for the 5 services that money needs to provide to society in order to exist, and work for us as a medium of exchange.

What are those 5 services that something has to have in order to become a currency?

1.- Divisibility: Money needs to be divisible, it's a pretty obvious one, if you wan't to buy something expensive you won be carrying 2 trucks full of coins with you, you can just make bigger measures of money or smaller ones for cheap things like a can of soda.

2.- Durability: It needs to be stand the proof of time, and I'm not talking about the agreement on a certain Fiat currency such as USD or EUR, I mean, if you store 5 apples in a bank they're going to be worth nothing in a few days (if you use apples for exchanging goods), but if you put coins, paper, or gold it will be there for a long, long time.

3.- Recognizability: Each trading party can verify the authenticity of the money. Meaning that every transaction that I'm giving you money, you can be secure if it is real, by putting in into that light that reflects certain materials that they put into money, if it would be gold there are other ways to verify if it's real.

4.- Portability: Pretty obvious one, you must be able to move it across time and space without problem.

5.- Scarcity: This is the most important thing about money, and one of the best ways that crypto it's better than Fiat money ruled by Goverments. Scarcity occurs when the demand outstrips supply, so when there is a demand of a certain currency there will be a supply of that currency.

Crypto, just makes the checkmark over these 5 services, and specially Scarcity. Why? Governments and the people who control the flow of currencies, **ALWAYS** takes advantage of the position where they are in, and just print more of that currency in order to have more for them, and less for everybody else, this is just human nature, and you can study a little bit of history and you will notice that this repeats over time on every society. 

In the case of Bitcoin, we just have supply of 21,000,000 coins, and no one can make more out of tin air like governments do, when they please. So Scarcity, it's the main advantage that crypto and bitcoin has over Fiat currencies.

So if you ask me, for the reasons that I just gave, Hillary Clinton, just point out the fact that Crypto, it's making the work that we all expect it to be making over time, and it's doing it fast.

Ps: This post was remake by myself, last one got deleted, for having no source.

Also, In no shape or form this is a political attack on Hillary, it's just a perspective and speculation around the main reason on why Crypto was created."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3939276|public|self|||Hillary Clinton declaration, might just mark the second leg of this bull run.|1|[]|0.88|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qxmi8h/hillary_clinton_declaration_might_just_mark_the/||all_ads|6|1637327107.0||||||||||||2021-11-19 18:35:07+00:00|t3_qxmi8h|0|140||

IMO transparency, trust are probably the most important aspects of a project
This wasn't even anything major like with what happened to other projects . I sometimes had to wait a few seconds or try again or change the RPC

Recap 11-19-2021 RPC Perfomance Postmortem
""Users of Harmony dApps were experiencing a significant increase of delays and transaction failures on Thursday, November 11th. Logs and performance metrics showed drastic fluctuations of CPU utilization on West Coast RPC nodes. While we lack a definitive root cause due to the log file verbosity, we took a handful of proactive measures to help prevent this issue. Steps Taken
One significant milestone was the expansion of our RPC footprint. We have geographically expanded our RPC endpoints which now span the US West Coast, US East Coast, EMEA, and APAC regions. Another significant change involves optimization of RPC, Using latency-based routing, that traffic should now redirect to the closest region based on lowest latency from the client. Which RPCs To Use
For wallets, please use redacted For developers, we suggest redacted Routing to Pocket Network was paused due to a handful of issues and may route back to them at a later date. For now, we plan to keep our current, new method of RPC load balancing. We suggest not using Pocket Network until further notice. Moving Forward
Harmony has entered an agreement with another external and decentralized RPC endpoint provider, Covalent, to continue expanding our RPC footprint. With Covalent, developers can quickly and easily create a new RPC node for themselves. This will help distribute the increasing traffic, and provide added layers of redundancy. More to come on that over the next few weeks. We are also discussing additional performance improvements through process optimization on the RPC nodes. Our aim is to continue improving the overall RPC experience for everyone. Additional Info
DeFi Kingdoms also made a number of changes to help scale their ability to handle the increase in traffic. After identifying our Graph node was behind on indexing the chain, the DeFi Kingdoms team worked overnight to build a handful of dedicated nodes to optimize performance. Closing the Loop
These recent technical milestones will allow us to handle up to 4x more RPC traffic; a significant leap in scale and reliability. We hope you find this update helpful and thank you greatly for your patience as we work to continue improving RPC performance for you all. Hope to see you all in the community channels."""|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3946127|public|self|||The transparency of Harmony One vs other projects.

So I’m seeing various broker apps offering free btc upon signup and/or initial deposit. Is there any harm in taking advantage of all these signup incentives? Would I be opening too many accounts with different brokers and/or would this make my taxes a mess?

I want to run through and scoop up all the btc incentives but don’t want this to become confusing and backfire. Afterwards, I’d try to consolidate all that earned btc to one broker or wallet. I guess I could shut down my accounts with them after transferring. Thoughts?

I'm looking for the platform with the highest apr for whatever stablecoin: it could be USDT, USDC, BUSD, UST etc.
I prefer platforms where you don't have to invest in a collateral. 
For now I prefer not to consider DeFi platforms where you have to invest in a couple of coins.
Up to now,, I think the first one is terrastation, it gives 19,5% on UST but you have to buy LUNA and then exchange in UST, the second one is crypto.com Earn where it gives up to 14% but you have to invest a lot of money and block it for 3 months.

I figured, hey why not. They seem to have every coin available, apparently the most ""up-to-date"" pricing for every crypto (which mystifies me still because every exchange claims this same thing), and were promising ""0% fees for the first 30 days"". Well that all sounded good enough for me to join up. So I did. I wired some money in, no problems there. I bought some coin, no problems there. No fees apparently either. Then it dawned on me that they don't have a ""limit"" option and they force you to pay ""market"" prices. Well technically that's any price they want you to pay, not actually market pricing. Either way, I was going to let my money sit in over night on a play that I thought might net me 10% and sell in the morning. I woke up, 10% was more like 7% and I opted to sell either way. Well lo and behold I go to cash out about $300, or so I thought, and all of a sudden I'm only able to net $43. I look at why that is and even though the price of the coin was actively at $3.52, I was being forced to sell at $3.36 which basically eliminated all of my profit. Oh and the little sell screen that came up made sure to mention that there were ""0 fees"" on this transaction. So there you have it, real time price manipulation to steal your money. I'd rather pay a fee and know the fee going into it, but this is a sneaky way of taking money from people by telling them that they're selling at prices that aren't actually based in reality. They're selling your coins at prices that net them profit and leave you with....next to nothing. Avoid [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) \- they're garbage.

So I'm closely following crypto since the early beginning - i work in crypto, but have a few questions which really bug me. How the hell do influencers target the people who have no idea of bitcoin?

I personally have many social media accounts, using Instagram I'm certain Facebook has my cookies as well even if i try to delete them. Using Google 90% of the time for my daily, multiple hour long research, I can assume that basically every tech giant knows that I would be a perfect target for crypto advertisment.
To confirm that: yes, i do get targeted Ads from various serious exchanges (where I am already registered, because I use many different exchanges) but here comes the twist of my observation: 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY SCAMMY ADS OR INFLUENCERS SHOVING THEIR SHILLS IN MY FACE.
Only the most legit projects, and exchanges as legit as it can get. The only Ad i've ever seen that i think should be illegal is a HitBTC Ad, since they really do shady stuff.

I get Ads for seriously new project with very good technical whitepapers, ads from the imho best exchanges, ads for crowdloans.
But i still read multiple times a day that people are getting shilled by influencers, buy into scam projects due to ads or get scammed somehow else which really hurts us all by damaging the reputation.
Beeing the *crypto-oracle* in my extended circle of friends and family I'm getting at least one call per week where somebody almost fell for a scam or already lost a chunk of money and then ask for help. If I can't protect my people neither can you and this needs to change.

I'm asking everyone a lot of questions to pin down how they made contact with the scam.
I'm not talking about hacks (e.g. someone saving 2$ on a windows 10 key by using a software cracker and getting drained as a result), just plain old scams.

About 80% of my friends/family who ever lost money claim that they found out about the hack via advertisement. Insta, Facebook, YouTube, GoogleAds. Either paid Shills or Advisement. (Most of them also never heard about reddit, although many scammers are here)

So, why am I NOT getting this Advertisment? I should clearly get these because I'm the absolute perfect crypto enthusiast, just like many of you fellow redditors.

I bet the scammers somehow are targeting people who know others that made money with crypto but know nothing about crypto themselves with social media ads.
Is this possible? Is this acceptable?
No wonder a customer on a social media platform can be worth big bucks. I honestly feel sad.


So, if you ever lost money on a scam, how did you find out about the scam?
Are you seeing scam ads?
Are shills getting shoved in your face?
Lets dig a little deeper together, because the system seems to be against the people, yet again."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3939564|public|self|||Crypto, Social Media and the State of Advertisment|0|[]|0.8|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qxnia9/crypto_social_media_and_the_state_of_advertisment/||all_ads|6|1637330034.0||||||||||||2021-11-19 19:23:54+00:00|t3_qxnia9|0|6||

DeFi – or decentralized finance – is a sector of the cryptocurrency industry that takes traditional financial services like loans and insurance and puts them on the blockchain. The main difference being, the decentralized financial applications these services run on are not controlled or maintained by any single company. Instead, they are managed completely by their own communities of users and through automatically executing computer programs known as “smart contracts.”

DeFi staking is a great way of generating an annual return on your deposited assets if you only plan on buying cryptocurrencies and holding them. The process is similar in nature to depositing money into a savings bank account except instead of earning less than 1% interest, you can typically earn anywhere between 5%-25% and in some cases, higher.

It is worth noting, however, that not all cryptocurrencies can be staked. There are also some other risks to be aware of when dealing with DeFi platforms. These include:

* DeFi platforms are not regulated. This means there are no consumer protections in place in the event you lose your capital from theft or fraud.
* A number of DeFi platforms have not had their computer code audited by a third party to ensure there aren’t any bugs or exploitable flaws. This leaves the platforms vulnerable to hacks and exploits. So far in 2021, $361 million has already been stolen from DeFi applications.

It’s recommended anyone looking to lock away funds in a DeFi staking application should perform his or her own rigorous due diligence beforehand.

Hope that helps, cheers."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3940137|public|self|||What Is DeFi Staking ?

The cynic in me can't help but think that they are scared of losing control of people's money.

The main culprits in my case were Nexo and Celsius transactions which I've been using for a while to get a better return on my non-emergency savings.

I could understand if this was the first time I've used them, but I've been DCAing fiat across every payday for the past 4/5 months.

Are they genuinely concerned for people's money, or am I correct in my theory that they are making it difficult for people for more nefarious reasons?

Over the last 9 months they've had an average of 200-350 daily active users.

For a game that's worth $8bn it's MASSIVELY overvalued.

Only this week has their userbase increased to over 1k but I don't see that being sustained due to how expensive Land sales are - which are at a very low volume btw.

You can see the active user data yourself here:


https://catalyst-monitor.vercel.app/


Compare this to a game like VRChat who's got 1m daily active users. VRChat is only worth about $1-2bn based on their last funding round.

There's no logical reason that a metaverse game with only 0.1% of the userbase of VRChat is worth 4x more than it.

It asks for 350€ in CRO for 6 months in order to get the benefits. Do you think is it worth the risk?

My question is what do you guys think of crypto.com’s recent huge ventures into trying to make themselves big players in this market? Is it real? Also their own coin?
