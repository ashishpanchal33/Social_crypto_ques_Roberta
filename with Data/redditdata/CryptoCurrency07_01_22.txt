Yesterday, somebody in the comments of some thread asked for an ELI5 on why US bond rates matter and what their relationship is with markets and economies. What I wrote ended up being more like an ELI12, and also ended up being quite long; in any case, I have decided to modify it a bit and turn it into its own post.

# What are bonds

First, an introduction on what bonds actually are. 

Simply put, a bond is the ""asset side"" of governmental or corporate debt. When a government or corporation borrows money, the borrower now holds a liability, and the lender holds an asset, which is expected to return them their original investment (the money they lent) plus profit (interest) at some later date. A bond is basically a token that says some government or company owes you some amount of principal by some date known as the maturity date (usually 3 months to 30 years, depending on the type of bond), plus interest. Because bonds are a tokenization of debt, they can be easily traded in a liquid, open market, just like stocks. This means that the original lender does not need to be the person who is repaid when the bond matures; the repayment and interest simply goes to whomever holds the bond at the time.

There are two main types of bonds: corporate bonds, and government bonds. 

Corporate bonds are the main way companies raise money, apart from selling shares. 

Government bonds are how the government raises money to cover budget deficits (ie: when the government spends more than they have the tax revenue to spend, they borrow the remainder by selling bonds to whomever will buy them). If nobody is buying the government bonds, the interest will go up organically due to supply and demand until people are willing to buy them. Government bonds are often known as **treasuries**, and are broken down into three categories: treasury notes (short-term maturity), treasury bills (mid-term maturity), and treasury bonds (long-term maturity).

One of the main buyers of US government bonds is the Federal Reserve, which is the name of America's central bank. This is the entity that is able to actually print US dollars. Everyone has heard of things like how the US government recently ran huge deficits due to ""stimulus spending"", and that it printed the money it needed for that spending. Well, this is a slightly inaccurate picture of how it works. The government chooses fiscal policy, which means they build the budget and they set the tax rates. They are the ones who choose to overspend and run a deficit. However, they don't choose monetary policy: they cannot print money. This power was delegated by congress to the Federal Reserve over 100 years ago. 

So, when the government runs a deficit, they sell bonds to borrow the money. If the FED chooses to, it can print a whole bunch of money and then lend that money to the government (ie: the taxpayer) by buying the government bonds with it. That is how newly printed money actually gets into the economy: the FED prints it and then lends it out to companies and to the government by buying corporate and government bonds. When the FED buys a bunch of treasuries (government bonds), it is really lending out freshly-printed cash to the American people (since the government's liabilities are really the taxpayers' liabilities), and the people then owe that money, with interest, back to the FED by the time the treasury matures. 

When the FED decides to buy up the government's bonds in order to lend the to the taxpayers the money that congress is spending, they are also putting downward pressure on the bond interest rate. This is because, if the FED decided *not* to lend a bunch of money to the government to cover its deficits, the bond interest would organically rise through supply &amp; demand until other buyers (individuals, companies, foreign investors, whatever) are willing to buy those bonds.

So, when the FED wants to keep bond interest low, they achieve this indirectly by creating what is basically artificial demand for US bonds by buying a ton of them with money that they printed at no cost to themselves. Due to how supply &amp; demand works with debt, the more demand there is for bonds, the lower the interest those bonds offer.

So, the Federal Reserve executes its main task of managing the US bond rate by choosing how much government debt it buys. If they want bond rates to go up, they will print less cash and buy fewer bonds. If they want it to go down, they will print more cash and buy more bonds.

The FED is essentially a whale with the power to print money, who uses said printed money to manipulate the US bond market, ostensibly for the good of everybody.

# The risk-free rate

The interest rate on American government bonds is considered one of the most important variables in the American (and even worldwide) economy. This is because the American gov is considered the de facto safest borrower of all borrowers in the world. In other words, if I buy an American government bond, I am lending my money to the entity that is considered to have the smallest risk of defaulting in the world (maybe this is arguable, but regardless this is a premise that is at the core of the world economy; what's important is that people believe it).

There is a concept in economics called the ""risk-free rate"". This is the interest you can get for lending your money to a 0-risk borrower, and should logically be the lowest interest rate you see anywhere in that economy. Of course, there is always technically some risk when you lend money, so the risk-free rate is technically imaginary. However, in practice, just about everybody considers the US bond rate (specifically, treasury bills, the US bond with the shortest maturity) to be the risk-free rate, as the risk is considered to be so low as to be negligible. 

So, if buying American gov bonds is the safest way to lend money, it means that every single other form of loan must pay higher interest. Why? Because every other borrower is considered higher risk, and for me as a lender, I will not accept less interest for greater risk. So, if American bond interest goes up, all other loan interest (corporate bonds, bank loans, mortgages, credit cards, whatever) will organically go up, because everything must pay greater interest than American bonds to compensate for greater risk. This is simply a matter of supply &amp; demand mechanics.

So, American bond interest is kind of like the baseline or the ""sea level"" for all interest rates in the entire economy. This even stretches to other countries, because anyone can buy a bond from the US gov, and they are considered the safest borrower in the world, so nobody will ever lend money to anybody else unless they are compensated with greater interest than US bond interest.

# The cost of capital

So, if US bond rates go up, and therefore all interest in the economy goes up, that means money itself has gotten more expensive. Loan interest is literally just the cost of money (known as the cost of capital). The lesser the interest, the cheaper it is for me to acquire money right now. When you realize that the entire world runs mainly on credit, it becomes clear how significant this phenomenon is.

So, when US bond rates go up, the price of capital itself goes up. That means it becomes more costly for businesses to raise money, more costly to mortgage a house, more costly to open a line of credit to buy investments, more costly to spend with credit cards, more costly to use leverage in securities markets, etc.

This means that growth goes down, spending goes down, wages go down, etc. It also means the prices of goods go down (or at least climb slower), because people aren't willing to pay as much, since capital itself is more expensive to acquire.

What happens when prices go down? Well, that's a reduction in inflation. So, when inflation is getting too high, the FED (central bank) will make bond interest go up to apply recessive forces on the economy to curb said inflation.

If inflation is low, the FED might reduce bond interest in order to make the cost of capital lower to juice the economy, prop up securities markets, and incentivize growth. Too much growth though, and we end up with inflation again, meaning the FED might increase rates again. This causes a sort of wave-like dance between bond rates and the heat of the economy.

So, the FED influences bond rates ostensibly to keep the economy balanced: not too hot and inflationary (can be very bad) and not too cold and deflationary (also can be very bad).

It is also worth noting that the FED wields a couple other levers it can use to increase or decrease the cost of capital (ie: the general interest rates in the economy) that are separate from bond rates. They can change the reserve requirements of banks (what percentage of total assets a bank must hold in reserve). If banks need to hold more in reserve, then they have less liquid money to lend out, so the supply of capital goes down, so market interest (cost of capital) rises. Also, the FED can change the discount rate, which is the amount of interest they charge banks for short-term loans (24 hours of less) from the FED itself.  When these rates go up, banks are disincentivized from borrowing from the FED, which means they need to be more conservative about the loans they themselves give out, which makes the supply of capital go down and thus the cost of capital go up.

# What does this mean for markets?

Now, when bond rates go up, most investment markets go down. Why? Well, the higher bond rates go, the more I can make by investing in bonds, without the risk going up. So, as bond rates go up, it becomes more and more attractive to move my wealth out of riskier markets like stocks and into what is considered the safest investment market in the world: US bonds. Since rates going up means I get greater returns on my bond investments, but the risk doesn't change, US gov bonds become more and more sensible to an investor as the rates increase.

Of course, bonds rates going up a smidgen doesn't actually suddenly make bonds a strategically more sound investment than riskier things like stocks. In fact, US bond rates have been so comically low for so long that it hasn't made much sense to buy bonds in years (decades, really). However, when people hear that the FED is going to increase bond rates, they think ""bond rates going up means people will sell stocks to buy bonds, so I better sell now to front-run that"", which is the main thing that *actually* causes stocks to fall when bond rates increase.

How crypto will fare with increasing bond rates is unknown, because rates have been declining ever since BTC was born, until very recently. Personally, I imagine crypto will follow stocks down if rates go up too much, but nobody knows for sure.

# Some historical context

US bond rates hit an ATH in 1981 around 15%. Unsurprisingly, the stock market hit a low at the same time (like I said before, you should expect an inverse relationship between bond rates and most securities markets). Think about how ridiculous 15% bond rates are. That would mean you could buy what is definitionally the safest investment available and get 15% returns each year. By contrast, the safest stock ETFs (still way riskier than US bonds) average like 7% a year.

So, in the 80s, you could double your money every 5 years while accepting what is usually considered 0 risk. Ever wonder why boomers seemed to get wealthy so easily? This is one of the reasons.

Since the ATH in 1981, bond rates have fallen continuously until Covid hit, at which point it pivoted at a low of about 0.5%. Since then, bond rates have been going back up, but are still extremely low, at around 1.5%.

Since bond rates going down means stocks go up, the stock market has been in a tremendous and arguably unnatural bull run for about 40 years, only pausing twice very briefly for ""corrections"" circa 1999 and 2008.

Since US bond rates have gotten so close to 0%, they can't really lower them any further without going negative (which is actually a thing, and some countries are trying negative interest now. This is related to Modern Monetary Theory, and is an extremely rabbit hole that nobody really knows the true consequences of yet. Imagine getting paid to borrow money. Some countries have been experimenting with this over the last 7 years). The chair of the FED (Jerome Powell) said a few months back that they have no intention of going to negative interest rates, so that means these past 40 years of propping up markets by reducing bond rates has probably come to an end. 

You could think of the continuous lowering of rates for the last 40 years as the FED spending its ammunition to prop up markets and propel economic growth, but now that rates are barely above 0% and the FED isn't willing to go negative, they are out of ammo. Not only are they out of ammo when it comes to lowering the rates, but they are also currently incentivized to *increase* rates to combat rising inflation.

This is why there is fear. The FED has been sticking its hands in for 40 years to prop up markets, and now they are going to stop.

I then bring that pickup to my garage and let it sit.   1 year later today, that pickup truck is now worth $22,000.    The value of that vehicle actually didn't go up much at all.  It's still worth the same.   The dollar  is weaker, so you need more dollars to buy it.   If the dollar was stronger than the day I got it,  It would probably be worth a tad less. Maybe $19,500.  Still, it holds the same relative value as the $22,000 scenario.   The dollar is worth more so I now need less dollars to buy it.  

In the case of crypto. Bitcoin.  Bitcoin has fallen in value.   This is partly due to demand obviously, but it it shouldn't be this low.  It should be naturally rising at it's current demand due to inflation.  It's not. 

So it's getting weaker against the dollar.   Simple maff.   There's not much to see.   The demand has been roughly the same the past few months.

=================================================

This is perhaps one of the more pervasive data backed narratives going, and I will admit that I bit in early 2021-and got burned: 

[Got A Sure Thing? \(well, there's an ointment for that....\)](https://preview.redd.it/jurdggyak4a81.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdc3c3951d3169466911462cf5160ba74c7a2246)

 Ok, this is a great example because it has performed reliably in history. Pattern is strong on this.

The story goes that if rate X exceeds level Y, then growth assets get hammered big time.

In q1/q2 2021 this was trotted out, and what happened? Growth just trashed it into year end. (Apple even outperformed Bitcoin in 2021.)

*Why?*

Good question!

I believe it is simply because Growth was producing the lion's share of the market returns, and so the risk posed by the narrative's boogey man was shrugged off \*meh\*.....and the party continued irrespective of the strong narrative.

Now here we are \~a year later, and my my my......same story, same FED, nothing really new. (Yes, I have read the headlines...the FED said Z.)

**Meanwhile, is what was present back in the 2021 day noted, still present today?**

It is.

So what do I think will happen *this time?*

Rinse &amp; repeat.

Will it be as heady? No. Will it be as bold? No. Why? Means reversion. 2021 was an outlier year, after 2020, an outlier year. Now gravity sets back in a bit.

Sure, the entire environ is different a year later....but the biggest gorilla in the room (huge newly printed money seeks best inflation beating gain), has not. Yes, FED speak has gotten more aggressive, but the correlated actions have been on the radar screen for a good long time. The ""surprise"" is a black swan, and that black swan is delivered by the Skynet Media Corp. :) Rupert Murdoch lives to sell another media product another day-and so on.

**The Big Kahuna: there is a lot of money to put to work, (those untiring 2020-2021 printing press products).**

Where's it gonna go?

*Proctor &amp; Gamble......or Tesla-ites?*

It will go where ROI is most likely to be located. My belief (data backed) is that will not be P&amp;G. ;)

The Cryptoverse is a poster child for yield; it is hot, it is all the rage, it is productive, it is efficient, it is a future value factory*-it is growth personified.*

\*\*\*

**TLDR:**

**Summary: even the best data backed well tested narratives fail....when stronger data swamps them.**

**That is the set up here, as we have more money floating around with more places for it to work than ever in human history.....by a very VERY large measure, (expressed in ""trillions"").**

**The Easy Street of 2021 is over, but 2022 still has all the same houses and residents, and they are gonna drive from here to there-period.**"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4276705|public||https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/IHWsCEyRCIoMPgPp2KzsaVe6RE89m0kX94wgfukbjSg.jpg|When Data Based Narrative Fails: Example 1|0|[]|0.57|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rxo7tw/when_data_based_narrative_fails_example_1/|all_ads|6|1641481366.0|||128.0|140.0||{'jurdggyak4a81': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'jurdggyak4a81', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/jurdggyak4a81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af944b56dfceb5850515ffb63929cb90abe69b12', 'x': 108, 'y': 99}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/jurdggyak4a81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bef2086289e4aacb93807d8488519c93dda2da7', 'x': 216, 'y': 198}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/jurdggyak4a81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ba556979f402e33ab33a42812d0dda08c5d6405', 'x': 320, 'y': 293}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/jurdggyak4a81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cf651bcb28e1b3f108cf9ddd4e067b8a9c883e1', 'x': 640, 'y': 587}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/jurdggyak4a81.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdc3c3951d3169466911462cf5160ba74c7a2246', 'x': 762, 'y': 699}, 'status': 'valid'}}||||||2022-01-06 20:32:46+00:00|t3_rxo7tw|0|1||

I don't care if it's as simple as trying a new wallet or something more complicated like writing and employing my own trading bot.  If it's new, it counts.

I'd love to hear more ideas so I can pick from them and form a nice list of possibilities.

This week was simple, I set it up so that a percentage of my paycheck gets converted to bitcoin automatically.

Next week is moving my ZNN from the legacy wallet to the new wallet.

I've also got on the list:

* Participate in a liquidity pool
* Utilize a grid bot
* Run a node for a cryptocurrency
* Create my own trading bot and run it from a raspberry pi or similar
* Mine a cryptocurrency
* Send BTC via the Lightning network
* Sell a MOON
* Research CKB
* Learn Fibonacci Retracement Levels and Footprints
* Use a DEX
* Watch all of the Blockchain at Berkeley videos
* Contact my Senators/Representative and express my opinion on the importance of crypto within the future of our country
* Create a paper wallet
* Mint an NFT
* Propose a Moon Governance Poll

Most often we see blame being hurled at 'whales' with accusations of market manipulation, attempts to shake down leveraged holders, or even competition between whales for market dominance.  Other crop-up conspiracies include governmental/instututional interference and impact from events in small market economies (most recently, Kazakhstan).  Frequently, these posts reference sources of known dubious character.  Interestingly, conspiracy theories tend to fall away when the market makes a solid upturn.  

Of course, none of these aforementioned are likely causes of market crashes.  Whales, for example, have far more to lose by selling huge portfolios all at once as they get slammed by market spread, and then again face exactly the same problem when buying back in, all the while being hit with exchange fees.  Likewise, events within small market economies are unlikely to cause market wide impacts, though the possibility of hitting a small number of tokens is not out-with the realms of possibility.

Conspiracies are nothing new to markets and certainly not unique to crypto.  Popular psychology suggests the human mind feels a need to look for deeper meaning to unexpected 'catastrophic' events, as ordinary machinations seem somehow incapable of such momentous outcomes.  But perhaps we shouldn't rely on pop-sci to explain this phenomenon.  Conspiracies garner attention in a world where visinility is an increasingly valuable commodity.  Even within this subreddit, there are outward influences to motivate such actions.  The potential reward of moons for karma, for example, almost certainly skews posts in favour of those that grab attention or have positive outlook.  Shocking headlines certainly sell views!

Keeping a clear head is important.  Most abrupt market changes tend to have simple triggers which result in a stampede.

TLDR; **Investing only what one can afford to lose, doesn't automatically makes you emotionless. That's just plain utter bullshit.** TLDR at front so you won't need to read my ranting any further.

First off, nah I didn't sell even a single coin. Although some coins are in the red, overall I'm still in the green. I feel like I need to say this since some people attack the person instead of the argument/statement. Good old ad hominem.

So yeah, this phrase is uttered here every single minute of every day. I admint that it's one of the important rules of investment, and common sense. I do say this as well, once in a while not gonna lie. The thing is, people blurts this line every time they can. 

Are you worrying about your investment? *^(Only invest what you can afford to lose.)*

Panicking on dips? *^(Only invest what you can afford to lose)**.*

Emotional? *^(Only invest what you can afford to lose.)*

Oh no, what should I d- ^(Only invest what you can afford to lose.)

People keep blurting this out like it's some magic phrase to validate someone losing money and disregard everything else. I don't know about others but losing money is never fun for me. If I want to be happy losing money, I'd go to a hooker or smoke weed.

I understand that people panicking are a bit annoying. But I'm sure as hell I'm not the only one who gets emotional or sad or cranky if my money depreciates, regardless if it's money I can afford to lose or not. It's money I can afford to lose true, but that doesn't mean I'm fine losing it ffs. Money is money. Hard-fuckin-earned money. Devoiding oneself of emotions when it comes to money is easier said than done. Unless the money you're playing around with is just a drop from the ocean.

However, if you interact with the ethereum blockchain, there is still a way how you can save a lot of fees.

When you do a transaction on Ethereum, your wallet will suggest a fee based on the current gas price. The gas price is extremely volatile and sometimes peaks to really high prices. If you do a transaction during such a peak, you will pay incredible high amounts in fees.

But that's not necessary. Most wallets, e.g. Metamask, let you configure the fees yourself. Right now the [gas price](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) is 180 GWEI. This is extremely high, however if you look at the [history chart](https://ethereumprice.org/gas/) of the gas price, you see that it is regularly below 60 gwei, it even has been at 30 GWEI a few times since the beginning of the year. 

So instead of using the gas price your wallet suggestes, simply configure the gas price yourself, set it to the amount of GWEI you would like to pay, e.g. 60 GWEI, and pay only one third of fees.

Your transaction might take a few hours until it goes through, but i waiting a few hours will be worth saving hundreds in gas fees.

[This](https://ethereumprice.org/gas/) website does show you what the prices have been in the last few days, so you can find out what a good price would be so your transaction goes through. If you set it too low, it might take days for it to go through, maybe will never happen.

Yesterday i bought btc, eth, sol, matic for 200$ and wanted to invest another 250 today but the market crashed. 

My question is. Should i invest today or wait a few weeks to see where the market is gonna move? Im not fearful im rather trying to see another possible dip. 

Maybe its a stupid question since im here for the long term but i would like to know your opinion.

I'm struggling to see how this would not be the same in a fully Bitcoin system.

For example, if someone took a loan of 0.1 btc to buy a piece of land. Then the economy grew and there was an increase in output in goods and services to the extent that now your btc enables you to purchase more of the same goods and services. In this example there is deflation. But does this not hurt the person taking the loan e.g. The land is now 'worth' 0.05 btc due to the increased purchasing power of Btc. In this circumstance the borrower is now worse off.

Companies etc. rely on debt to grow a business or produce new productive technology e.g. Amazon, tesla etc.

OpenSea is already built upon years of fraudlent cross trading and highway robbery gas. It's just an ugly space, and I have no enthusiasm for it creeping onto other blockchain.

I crave NFT's backed by utility and real world interaction. Luckily they are happening and will be into the future.

Hopefully at the expense of Sexually Ambiguous Giraffes, for the low low price of 12 Eth and $4000 gas."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4277778|public|new|self|Are Digital Beanie Babies, aka every single thing on OpenSea, the most inflation prone 'hobby asset' we have ever seen?|0|[]|0.69|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rxsngt/are_digital_beanie_babies_aka_every_single_thing/|all_ads|6|1641493168.0||||||||||||2022-01-06 23:49:28+00:00|t3_rxsngt|0|7||

""Decentralization"": As many votes as your money.

People often claim that decentralization is the better alternative to centralized banking. They are right in some respects. But this comparison is often done badly. Decentralization is not so directly related to banking per se. Example: You can just save money in a locker at your home, or invest it by your choice.  That is decentralization too. And when it comes to organized loaning/borrowing, both crypto and fiat can be made more decentralized. But the reality of implementing this crucial ""banking"" part, in a ""safe and easy"" manner, is messy in either case. 

 Lets imagine that we pass all laws which received more than 51% approval. In case of a democracy, representatives who write these laws are directly elected by people. In a ""decentralized"" system, voting as well as any choosing of ""representatives"", is done mostly by people with the most money. But in a world where money itself is extremely centralized, ""decentralization"" based on that money is a joke. 

 The concept of decentralization can potentially make our current situation worse. One major reason why people often dislike their democratically elected governments is that the govt is prone to corruption. The rich people often succeed in buying out (lobbying) the elected people. Govts then have no qualms in passing laws that benefit these few at the expense of the vast majority. This leads to an increasing public discontent. But at the very least, our representatives still need to convince us that they are the ""better"" option out there. With a ""decentralized govt"", even that would be unnecessary because most of us wouldn't have any vote. The top 1% would already own 51% of the vote. 

Here is a terrible scenario: Let all transactions start taking place in a crypto called XCoin, so that fiat is pretty much deserted. Of course we will still need to pay for law and order, the infrastructure of water, electricity, roads, hospitals, the army etc. So we have to tax XCoin directly. Citing efficiency, lets imagine that they make a system where taxation is built into XCoin itself. Each time you transfer money or buy stuff with XCoin, it is automated to deduce a tax fee. 

 And why is this scenario terrible? Because the richest are now basically the ""XCoin tax government"" with their 51% vote share in it. They can change the free structure within the governance rules as per their wish. What if they want even bigger tax breaks, paid for by you? Thats as easy as flipping up their laptop lids and making a few clicks. If any democratic government structure remains at this point, it is firmly under the financial control of the XCoin government.

""But wouldn't this hamper adaptation? Wouldn't people just stop using XCoin and move to another crypto which didn't treat them like this"". Well, they can't. If XCoin adaptation reaches such levels, people won't have the option to ""reject"". Example: Employers will pay in XCoin. Take it or go jobless. And the funniest part is, all this could be done under the pretext of ""Power to the people"". Under the garb of ""decentralization"". Anyone who objects to this corporate slavery could be branded as being ""anti freedom"".

I do invest in crypto. But rather than leaving its governance completely to the richest people, I would like my democratically elected government to thoroughly regulate crypto. Fiat and crypto will then co-exist. And it would not matter whether the cryptocurrency governance itself is centralized or decentralized; Because people will decide which crypto they want to use. Thus, our capitalist markets would decide the fate of the individual cryptocurrencies. This is how capitalism always works. There is no reason to replace it with corporate slavery.

Efficiency, lower transaction rates, speed, security etc list among the things that I look forward towards crypto for. Decentralization is not on the list.

(Side note: Overall, keeping money in a bank is like keeping crypto at an exchange. You are basically giving someone else the power to do whatever they want with it. But crypto exchanges are actually much worse than banks, because they are under-regulated. Example: Exchanges can just stop you from withdrawing when the price is expected to go down, citing some technical/maintenance mumbo jumbo.

There are many scam-wallets out there.)"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4278186|public||self|"Is ""decentralization"" an unnecessary evil?
