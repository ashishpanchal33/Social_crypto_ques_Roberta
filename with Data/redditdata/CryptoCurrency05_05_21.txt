 They may keep perfect to the penny records, may keep a loose track, they may know approximately how much they spend or they may not know at all.

And this is a problem, because if you do not know what your lifestyle costs, then you'll never know when you've won.

So here is the question for all you people making money on crypto. Do you know what your 'enough' is. How much crypto you'd need in order to be financially independent, whether that be a lump sum to be withdrawn and invested elsewhere, a value of staked earnings or income through liquidity pools etc.

Because if you don't know when you've won, then you'll always be chasing a bigger payday, because really who can resist adding just a bit more to the pile. Just one more day of HODL'ing, just one more risk.

One more dance along the Razors edge hoping you don't fall.

Because the point of all of this is to acquire sufficient wealth to do the things you want. To retire, to be financially independently, to travel, do charity, buy the lambo, whatever.

Let me give you an example. If you were staking ADA, and it was at 1 pound per coin, and your lifestyle cost was 2000 £ a month, you'd need somewhere in the neighbourhood of 300k coins to generate 2000 new coins a month. 

I realise that may seem daunting, but at least if you've done the maths, you'll know what your target is. Obviously the numbers may change as you acquire more, if the price changes or if the staking percentage changes, but once you've done the maths, it's easy to adjust. 

I've been so deep in the financial hole I was staring at days of not hours till bankruptcy, and as a result I've built a lifestyle I'm content with. I know what number I need to reach what value I need my coins and staking returns to get to in order to get what I want, which is true independence from the constraints of the rat race.

That's my enough, I know what the number is, calculated against inflation and my age and expected lifespan.

So once the emotions are settled down , please read below .

1000s of years ago, humans were perfectly decentralized. Everyone lived on their own or in small groups .  But by nature of evolution and survival of fittest , it always makes sense to group into larger numbers and control resources. That eventually lead to monarchy, dictators and eventually governments . My thought is that as of now crypto is mostly decentralized as most rich and powerful individuals and govts have not fully taken interest . But when they do what is stopping then from for example from controlling bitcoin mining power. If china or US decide to they can easily get 51% mining power . None of us can do anything about it . Even for proof of stake , if the voting power is based on number of coins held , here again the rich and powerful will end up controlling it if they decide to. For PoS where we nominate validators by voting , how it is different from our current democracy where we vote for reps. Eventually control over blockchain will be dependant on how rich it powerful a person is. We already see some episodes of bitcoin price manipulation .

Are there any protocols which take care of this ? We are still in early stages and some one might eventually come up with a mechanism to take care of this . But as of now has this problem already been solved ?

1. How does the new blockchain that's instantly decentralized begins? I mean, there had to be first node/device running it, is it just the creator/founder setting his own node and spreading it to others that connect? How did Bitcoin and all these PoW cryptos started in their first minutes, hours, days.
2. Something not likely probably but say we go through some magnetic/EMP shockwave or power shortage in entire world for whatever reason that turns off all devices/internet. Say it lasts even for a short time like 1h or less. How would the blockchains resume after it? Wouldn't it be a bit dangerous because of 51% attacks? Would the blockchains resume normally? Wouldn't some data, assets or transactions be lost? 
3. What will the miners for PoW cryptos do when the supply ends? I do get the idea that they get paid for transaction fees, but if the network won't have much volume, not many transactions (everyone holding crypto like gold), will there be incentive for miners to operate?

Looking forward to the next distribution, I've been unsure of how exactly to maximize the impact we can have on the world and how to best be the light of cosmic love. I've wondered if multiple people ought to receive funds, if I ought to pick one incredibly deserving person and just dump the sum of it, or some kind of backdoor giving to a charitable organization. Lots of questions, I've been meditating on it for some time. 

So what I may do is ask for you, the community, to message me and nominate your friend, your family, or a person in need who you feel most furfills my message of love and kindness. It can be anyone, but the kicker is that you cannot nominate yourself; the act of nomination itself must be a selfless act of kindness. 

In future distributions I will look to other methods, other means of kindness, and other avenues to share the love that radiates from the souls of us all, but for now I feel this is the way. 

The requirements: 

1. You may not nominate yourself. 

2. This person must live my message of kindness and love, demonstrably so. 

3. These won't be brief conversations, I must know for a fact that your nomination is legitimate, I'm putting my trust in all of you to come to me in good faith. 

4. If you nominate out of love, that love will come back to you tenfold ♥️


I'm putting life changing power in your hands, I'll be posting who I've chosen the day I can distribute what I have and encourage every one of you to donate to them too for maximum life changing karma. I will encourage them to post about what they'll do with the funds, be it feed their family, feed others, or spread the message of peace and love as far as their voice will carry; what they do with it is their choice alone and I will not judge that choice. 

Namaste and be love,

AAVE - Decentralised borrowing. People supply AAVE tokens which can earn supply interest, and people are also free to borrow tokens from the AAVE pools, I see huge potential for AAVE. 

MATIC - Layer-2 solution to the Ethereum gas fees at the moment, what Polygon is doing is great and Quickswap running on Polygon was amazing to use, nearly instant and nearly free token swaps.

SNX - Derivatives and synthetic assets on the Ethereum blockchain. The size of the derivatives market is colossal, capturing even less than a percent would be good for Synthetix. 

THETA - Decentralised streaming, has backing from Binance, Google, SONY, etc. big companies believe in this by hosting nodes, Mainnet 3.0 launching in roughly two months, should be exciting to see the upgrades to the network.

ZIL - Zilliqa is one of my favourite alts, Zilswap, sharding, what the team is doing (visible on Twitter) and they don’t even market the token. If they get some publicity, the token could easily rocket, in my opinion.

Some of it is crypto specific, some of it is general to investing. I thought I'd provide a quick guide here.

# Common Acronyms

**ADA -** the coin from the Cardano project, Cardano and Ada are sometimes used interchangably

**ALGO -** Algorand

**APY** \- Annual Percentage Yield. Basically how much interest the investment earns in an average year.

**ATH** \- All Time High. This means the highest price a coin/token has ever reached. ***Usage***: ""Ethereum just blasted past ATH and is now at $4500""

**BCH -** Bitcoin Cash. A fork (see definition of a fork under Terms) of Bitcoin, aiming to improve transaction speed

**BNB -** Binance token. This is a token distributed by the exchange Binance and can be used to pay for fees there at a lower rate than paying via cash.

**BTC -** Bitcoin

**CAKE -** Cakeswap token

**DCA** \- Dollar cost averaging

**DOGE -** Dogecoin

**ETC -** Ethereum Classic. Once upon a time there was a hack of an organization that caused tons of people to lose a lot of Ethereum. The ethereum blockchain was split into two - Ethereum Classic, which preserved the consequences of the hack, and Ethereum, which rolled back to prior to the hack.

**ETH -** Ethereum

**KYC -** Know your customer. See term definition below.

**LTC** \- Litecoin

**PoW** \- Proof of Work. See definition under terms. 

**PoS** \- Proof of Stake. See definition under terms.

**UNI** \- Uniswap token

**XLM** \- Stellar Lumens

**XMR -** Monero

**XTZ -** Tezos

# Terms

**Altcoin -** A coin that is not Bitcoin. Short for ""alternative coin"". Ethereum is sometimes still considered an altcoin although it is getting mainstream enough that it may not really fall under this definition anymore. 

**Bear market** \- refers to when the market has low confidence in an investment, and so the prices fall  
**Blockchain** \- at it's simplest, a series of blocks of information that are linked together by encryption. In crypto, this is where transactions are stored, meaning that wallet balances are also stored here.

**Bull market -** refers to when the market has high confidence in an investment, and so the prices rise. Sometimes people use the term ""bullish"" to suggest that something is indicating a bull market.

**Dollar cost averaging -** An investment strategy where you just invest on a set schedule, no matter the price. For example, you might decide to invest $100 in Ethereum on the first of every month. The theory here is that by doing this, you don't have to time the market and guess whether it will go up or down. When combined with hodling it can be a very effective way to make profits.

**Exchange** \- You have to have a way to turn your cold hard cash into amazing cryptocoins somehow. Basically an exchange is a place that facilitates you exchanging your fiat for crypto. Someone else sells their crypto, and you buy it. The exchange facilitates the transaction and takes a fee in return. Some common exchanges are Coinbase, Binance, Binance.US, Gemini, Kraken, Crypto.com 

**Fork -** This is a term from software development. Essentially, when something is open source and has certain licensing, it means that anyone can take the code and make their own version of it. Most crypto is this way. Therefore - anyone can go grab the codebase for a coin/token and make a fork, or their own version. Likewise, since the blockchains are public, anyone can take a blockchain at a certain point, and then make their own version, and continue from where that blockchain was at. Yes, you're hearing me right, you could go make your own version of Bitcoin if you were so inclined - it probably wouldn't go anywhere, but it is technically possible. Common examples of forks: Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin, Litecoin's codebase is forked from Bitcoin but the blockchains have no common history, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic were split by forking.

**Hash -** A non-reversible (or at least very difficult to reverse) calculation. Mess around with hashes here to get a better idea: [https://www.pelock.com/products/hash-calculator](https://www.pelock.com/products/hash-calculator)

**Hodl** \- an intentional misspelling of the word ""hold"". Refers to the concept that if you hold onto an investment long enough, you're likely to make huge returns, especially in the crypto space. Example - if you invested in Bitcoin at $1, you might have thought that selling at $10 was a good choice. However, if you'd invested $100 in bitcoin at $1, and held until now, you'd be a multi-millionaire. 

**Know your customer** \- This is usually used to mean when an exchange requires identify verification before you can purchase crypto. Typically this happens because a government requires it. Theoretically the idea here is that it makes crypto more traceable.

**Mining -** calculating hashes in a Proof-of-Work blockchain in hopes of being able to process a block, meaning you get the rewards

**Mining Pool -** a place where miners combine their computing power and split the rewards from any blocks that are processed in a Proof-of-Work system

**Proof-of-Stake -** an alternative to proof-of-work, where instead of calculating hashes, people ""stake"" their coins that they own. Who gets to process transactions and get the rewards is assigned out based on how much a staker has staked. 

**Proof-of-Work** \- a system where in order to process transactions (and thereby get the rewards for processing them), you have to be the first to calculate a hash. This means that ""miners"" spend their computing power to calculate hashes trying to be the first one to get the correct hash. The first miner to do so gets to process the transaction and therefore gets the rewards/fees.

**Shitcoin** \- a derogative term meaning a coin or token that is unlikely to amount to anything in the long run. It's rarely used as an insult though and is often just a joking way to refer to altcoins. 

**Smart contract** \- a feature some blockchains have that essentially allow them to be programmable/execute code. It means you could write an application that is embedded in and runs on the blockchain itself.

**Staking** \- putting your coins into whatever transaction processing mechanism in a Proof-of-Stake blockchain.

**Staking pool** \- where stakers combine their coin staking to increase their chances of processing a transaction, and then split the rewards.

**Take profits -** sell all or part of your crypto holdings to capitalize on profitable prices.

**Whale -** Someone who holds a large amount of a coin/token."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|2471552|public|self|A Newbie's Guide to Acronyms &amp; Terms on this Subreddit|1|[]|0.91|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n5jjwb/a_newbies_guide_to_acronyms_terms_on_this/|all_ads|6|1620211104.0||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '9hBhi6M7viitylBHVtdu3PgsNcG7kxllUO1N5kNHOQM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZPpHt-VeaYs7hD4kUxh_w_-rGw3bQpuJyU2azy6lq6Q.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bbc2d9eef74c8255813642c2faa7dacd3c23177', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZPpHt-VeaYs7hD4kUxh_w_-rGw3bQpuJyU2azy6lq6Q.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28a8e6c8a2c0b1dfefe1428d6ad6ed4a440c7518', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZPpHt-VeaYs7hD4kUxh_w_-rGw3bQpuJyU2azy6lq6Q.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=988bc36f2c8520991019f80c0fe63412a1fc7200', 'width': 320}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZPpHt-VeaYs7hD4kUxh_w_-rGw3bQpuJyU2azy6lq6Q.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16a313645baa207a104a88c99928190de750f60d', 'width': 640}, {'height': 960, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZPpHt-VeaYs7hD4kUxh_w_-rGw3bQpuJyU2azy6lq6Q.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d41cc8c36e7f0b8294fbb0cad3f0360ad330420', 'width': 960}, {'height': 1080, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZPpHt-VeaYs7hD4kUxh_w_-rGw3bQpuJyU2azy6lq6Q.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c57dfa5baad20897136ff64c8ca2fe583d049f8e', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1500, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/ZPpHt-VeaYs7hD4kUxh_w_-rGw3bQpuJyU2azy6lq6Q.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=ed6baf8b21bbc6e9629d035e6897731efbc36cfb', 'width': 1500}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||2021-05-05 16:08:24+00:00|t3_n5jjwb|0|52||

I actually searched and I made over 10x the average salary where I live.  
But as ^((almost)) every crypto newbie, I started telling people, I hadn't though about the risk it could have or anything like that, I was just making so much money I wanted to tell everyone. And naturally, they wanted in right?  
I never said there wasn't risk, I even teached a friend and he got 25% profit in 2 days!  


But last week, my cousin who's dabbled in crypto back in 2016 but forgot about it called me and said he would like to give me some money and invest FOR him, he knew the risks and that the thing that I kept repeating. Our deal was when he took out his profits, I would get to keep 10%.

I decided to convert to a stablecoin and stake it, increasing my balance instead. For those of us that get paid in advance or after finishing contracts, locked staking is perfect for the budget. 

It's said that you shouldn't invest more than you can lose, but i was already invested in losing money by having it in the bank.

Although not the adoption most are hoping for, i believe stablecoins will grow steadily in use even during the coming bear market. It's paired to fiat so it doesn't get affected by any bears. Lets you remove the greedy bank out of the chain and you can even gain interest.

Also helps with being able to invest at a more opportune time.

Let's say token X plans on emitting a total of 10 million coins over the course of the year.  At launch, they released a total of 2 million coins and plan to release 2 million more per month throughout the year until 10 million is hit.

Well, you can guess based on supply and demand what might happen to the price of the coin if the supply is increasing and demand doesn't keep up.  It goes down.  It can be particularly harsh if the market cap is steady and not growing.

Of course if you are invested in the long term, it might not matter too much, but new protocols are very unpredictable as it is and toss in a constant increasing demand, your best time to hop on board might be after emissions are complete or near complete.

- solves no issues

You can find it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n4sqwc/what\_is\_wrapped\_btc\_wbtc\_a\_short\_explanation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n4sqwc/what_is_wrapped_btc_wbtc_a_short_explanation/)

I'd recommend reading that post before trying to understand this post. 

Someone commented there that I should also explain renBTC, its pros and cons.

So here it is:

renBTC stands for wrapped bitcoins minted on the Ren Virtual machine. While WBTC requires a custodian, where an entity would take your BTC and convert it to WBTC, renBTC is minted using a smart contract. There is no trust required and hence no centralization. You generate renBTC by sending BTC to the renBTC address on the bitcoin blockchain, and equivalent renBTC will be generated in your wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Why would you wrap BTC?

i) BTC currently has high transaction costs. Wrapping it makes it an ERC-20 token which decreases the transaction costs (yes, gas fees are high now, but ETH2.0 will solve that problem).

ii) The only use case of BTC is p2p transaction. But if you tokenize it, it can be used for smart contracts. 

Why would you not wrap BTC?

i) Makes it less secure. If there's a bug in the smart contracts you can lose your WBTC/renBTC.

ii) If you are a BTC maximalist, wrapping BTC means that you are locking BTC to make WBTC/renBTC. This just increases ETH's utility, driving BTC's money on its blockchain. 

WBTC vs renBTC ?

It's a personal choice. Like between CEX and DEX ( centralized and decentralized blockchains).
