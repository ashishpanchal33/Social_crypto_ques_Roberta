**TLDR**:

Ultimately, tokenising the publication of the book is a new idea and also an interesting approach. This can extend to any right to use services or other resources such as libraries, to access certain features or to represent something. NFT tokens can all achieve these goals easily and they are quite new to be fully applied and known by many people. In the future, we believe the above will become the same as the way social media and e-commerce change users today.

# General Conclusion

What we can build within NFT is amazing because one of the pillars in the economic design framework is mechanism design. With mechanism design, we can build different kinds of mechanisms to allow more efficient allocation or investment in any particular resource. It can be more than just art or graphic design.

What if we can tokenise property rights, and instead of signing a thick legal contract you just sign on your smart contract with an embedded mechanism design! When you are selling and distributing these tokens there is a lot of economics and science behind them and that is what we want to talk about today. I also want to share the experiment that I am working on which is tokenising distribution rights and publishing rights of a book (my book!) as an NFT.

# Problems with Traditional Publishing

How I got started with this idea of tokenising publishing rights as an NFT is that I published a book and it took me two years of failures to finally release it. The first two years were difficult because nobody really wanted to publish the book. I went to a lot of publishing houses and spoke to a lot of editors but they found this to be very niche and risky for them and they did not want to invest. In property rights, long-term investment and allocation efficiency are the two trade-offs. In the investment area, a publishing house does not want to invest in a niche book because they do not know if there is demand for it, which is completely understandable. In addition, the bigger the publishing house the more risk-averse they will be.

# Allocation

Allocation efficiency means that the book needs to be allocated to the right kind of people who are actually interested in this field. Self-publishing is an efficient allocation because you are publishing and distributing it to the right people in your network.

# How the system works

In general, the token will represent the distribution rights for this specific book and the price of this distribution right will increase as more people come in to distribute it. The pricing model here is a way to express the risk aversion of the person distributing the book. When you are buying the distribution right or the NFT to be able to distribute the book during the early stages, it will be a lot cheaper because you are taking on more risk. I want to compensate you for taking on more risk by making it cheaper for you. As you go up the ladder you realise more and more people know about the book and more people are asking for it in different jurisdictions. Now there is an incentive for another person to come in to buy the distribution rights and distribute the book within their jurisdiction. In this scenario, there is less risk because there has already been promotion, advertising, and awareness of the book around the space, so you have to compensate for that by paying a higher price to buy the distribution and publishing rights.

There is a very simple bonding curve to measure how the system works. In the smart contract, you can embed things like expiration limits to the number of books and all those kind of funky things.

# The Need for Tokenisation

Tokenisation exists because it is a very powerful way to do internal calculations or accounting. When Bitcoin started, it was a way to create this global accounting system to correlate the buy-side and the demand on the sell-side. This is the same for physical books; there are distribution rights and agents will sell the books within their jurisdiction. Every time you sell the book you are promoting it in a lot of different ways.

Some people do not want to buy the physical book and just want the e-book. E-books are quite hard to calculate because someone living in Thailand might look at the book that is promoted in New Zealand but buy the book for a friend in San Francisco. In this case, it crosses many jurisdictions and compensating that advertising to the right kind of people is important. This is where tokens come in and the proportion of physical books sold can be used to calculate how much of the profits generated by the e-books will be added to these distributors so it becomes a new revenue stream for the distributors.

# Reselling &amp; Licensing

The [paper](https://anthonyleezhang.github.io/pdfs/dl.pdf) that Professor Anthony Lee Zhang wrote talks about depreciating licenses, where after a certain time a part of the license is resold to the market and you have to purchase it back to continue using it. If you don't want to use it anymore then you can resell it to someone else.

Everything can be done using the second price auction method which is the mechanism that was awarded the Nobel Prize last year. It is an evolution of this new area of mechanism and market design that is currently flourishing in the economic space.

There are a lot of ways that we can play around with this in the traditional world but I want to take these concepts and apply them in crypto because the testing time or experimentation term is a lot faster. It is a lot better for us to test these kinds of economic theses. As economists, we love creating and building beautiful models with a lot of assumptions that everyone is rational. Sometimes reality is not like that and the best way to test these theories is through actual experimentation.

If these experiments could be in radio spectrum or 5G spectrum allocation that would be great, but it is a bit too risky at this stage for government to come and experiment around in this space. We can start experimenting on a smaller scale like the licensing of book distribution so that we can figure out if there is allocation and investment efficiency and start scaling up from there to a lot of different areas. We can do this for other licensing mechanisms and in something like layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain validator allocation, especially when we are moving to the proof of stake system."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|716988|public|self|Experimenting Licensing as an NFT: EDBK Case Study|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/sbx72k/experimenting_licensing_as_an_nft_edbk_case_study/|all_ads|6|1643040314.0||dark||||||||||||||||2022-01-24 21:35:14+00:00|t3_sbx72k|0|1||

The term ICO is an acronym for Initial Coin Offering and simply put is a way of raising funds for a new crypto project. They are different from an initial public offering (IPO) because investing in an ICO will not give you an ownership stake in the company you are investing in. What you are doing, essentially, is gambling that a worthless crypto will be worth a fortune in the future. Another characteristic of ICOs is that they are stringently regulated, hence, anybody can launch an ICO. This thus makes them highly susceptible to scammers. In summary, they are high-risk but could be high-reward ventures.
Nonetheless, there is a way to reduce the risk associated with ICO’s. This is made possible by the Escrow Protocol. The Escrow Protocol is a decentralized trust fund that combines traditional crowdfunding with Blockchain technology. As the name implies ICO investment funds are held in escrow and released upon successful achievement of agreed milestones. Start-up projects seeking funding through ICO’s can lay out a roadmap of milestones and timelines to achieve these milestones in accordance with their actual capacity to do so, thus, establishing measurable criteria for delivering payments upon only fulfillable promises. Escrow Protocol’s incremental funding system allows for ICO funding to be managed with milestone-based micropayments and most importantly, an unprecedented investor oversight.
With this innovation, ICO accountability is assured, and investor trust is strengthened.

They all are Bitcoin Maximalists who provide content worth watching.

1. [Trader University](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraderUniversity)'s videos are college lecture style from someone who has a long background in finance so he actually knows what he's talking about. No clickbait, no shitcoins, no sensational titles or thumbnails. Just the cold hard facts. His videos aren't going to entertain you, but you will end the video smarter than when you started watching.
2. [Simply Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB6Q0S1gUHXMe5-Jjx0_laQ) is a daily webshow where a group of Bitcoin maximalists cover current events that are related to Bitcoin. They do a great job at keeping it entertaining, while going indepth into topics and news.
3. [Bitcoin Magazine](https://www.youtube.com/c/BitcoinMagazine/videos) is the Youtube channel for Bitcoin Magazine. They film and livestream Bitcoin conventions and events, and recently they started hosting a daily webshow on Bitcoin similar to Simply Bitcoin (although I prefer Simply Bitcoin's show).
4. [BTC Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/c/BTCSessions/videos) is a channel focused more on covering the Lightning Network, wallets, and other applications interacting with Bitcoin.
5. [Toxic Airwaves](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmA84qt35hSxBSxsXRCkWsg) is a webshow where two toxic Maximalists and talk about anything they want, often with a conspiracy bent (think Alex Jones type conspiracies). The topics can be mature so it's not for the faint of heart. They do a lot of satire and comedy bits.
6. [Dan Held](https://www.youtube.com/c/DanHeldBitcoin/videos)   is a top executive at Kraken who just happens to be a Bitcoin maximalist. He often has very insightful opinions since he is such a big insider in the industry
7. [What Bitcoin Did Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhatBitcoinDidPodcast) is a podcast hosted by Peter McCormack where he interviews prominent people in the industry. Production quality his high and the guests are great. My only criticism is that he never asks tough questions when he gets the opportunity to talk to people in positions of power. He is too friendly with the interviews.
8. [Off Chain with Jimmy Song](https://www.youtube.com/c/OffChainwithJimmySong/videos) is a channel where Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song talks about Bitcoin and sometimes interviews prominent people in the industry.
9. [Swan Signal](https://www.youtube.com/c/SwanSignal/videos) is a channel that discusses Bitcoin markets fundamentals.
10. [Tone Vays](https://www.youtube.com/c/tonevays) is a TA channel that hosts livestreams everyday.

All you ever talk about is BTC, ETH, ADA or any market cap over a billion. Well, apparently you’d be surprised to know, there exists other markets out there, and some are doing some mad work you’re missing out on. 

There’s a small market for new coins out there that are building and a completely new market that you are unaware of. Take for example, the Royal Falcons Club, their new approach towards NFT rewards is a revelation and an innovation and you know nothing of it. 

There are other coins than the top 10 or top 3 you always talk about. Don’t forget, the market was built on small projects and good ideas and it will continue to do so. So please if you’re into this market because you believe in it, stop being dogmatic and look at the projects building the future.

I mean people are still trying to put crypto and fiat in a battle. Like one is going to delete the other. That was never the case. Yeah crypto is the newer one here, but that doesn’t mean that it’s here to give any challenge to fiat money and vice versa.

I think that these assets will be used each in its way. But crypto is still relatively young comparing to the old fiat currencies, which means we will be seeing a lot of additions in terms of usage and utility, and we’re already seeing companies accepting crypto payments like Elon Musk’s Tesla. And also crypto platforms are also allowing their users to pay using their digital tokens, like of Binance, Coinbase, or CoinOvy for example. 

I think comparing these two genres of assets is literally a waste of time. I mean yeah it’s normal to hype crypto these days since it’s simply still new, and has a huge room for growth, but fiat is not going anywhere anytime soon. Both of them will be around for good."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|717672|public|self|Cryptocurrency and fiat money are not rivals.

However, if devs won’t change up their strategy NFT gaming will most definitely start losing hype.

We need something new to attract more players from outside of the NFT gaming scene.

Personally I think famous games like Legends of Elumia can be a great example considering how entertaining the storyline and graphics are.

I discovered today Aggregated Finance, and in my opinion it’s still underrated. They offer DeFi as a service. Let me explain: This DeFi 3,0 invests from it’s treasury and you get reflections as rewards from it’s profits.The investments are a 50/50 mix of DeFi 3.0 Project investments and standard Yield farms investments. After you buy the token, you get to participate in the DAO, where you get to help decide what the next trade will be. And part of the profit goes back to you as reflections and the rest into the treasury to be invested again. This is a great project in my opinion and you should definitely check it out.

Market analysts and experts discovered the first correlation between cryptocurrencies in 2017 when the collapse of Bitcoin led to the eventual drop in the capitalization of all other cryptocurrencies. The fact that Bitcoin jump-started the whole crypto industry has enabled it to have the final say regarding market sentiment. Additionally, traders and investors almost always check Bitcoin before deciding whether or not to sell their altcoin positions.

Simultaneously, there are times when a drop in Bitcoin’s value leads to a surge in an altcoin’s value. The most reasonable explanation for this is that investors will usually pull their capital out of Bitcoin investments and simply channel it to a promising altcoin. This action leads to a fundamental increase in the particular altcoin. Additionally, a promising altcoin that receives market hype, is capable of experiencing a bull-run all on its own. Therefore, it isn’t entirely true that all altcoins depend on Bitcoin.   
But for instance, every single time the price of Bitcoin rises, the price of altcoins rises as well. But why does this happen?

We’ve all been there before. In fact, I am there now. You are overwhelmed by so many market asset choices, so what should you get? Well, maybe the right answer, and the good advice to give is, you should research everything, and buy what convinces you. 

No matter how many YouTubers show you exact testimonials and precise metrics whether a cryptocurrency can make it or not, there’s always a matter of luck involved, but most often than not, your choice should come down to logic, and personal preference. A little anecdote, a while back I wanted to get into NFTs (yes the hype go to me), but I didn’t want any plain old NFTs, so I decided to get something that strays from the mold a little. So I started researching and came across the Royal Falcons Club, and their new system for NFT rewards, so I delved into it, and after some reflection, I bought in. This is not to say this project is good or not, more so as to say, personal choice matters. 

The best project isn’t what the YouTube creator tells you to buy, it’s what convinces you and grabs your attention.

Hey Reddit, welcome to this opinion post about decentralization, venture capital and blockchain development. We want to read you in the comments.

Several projects have sought to find new ideas or new developments for blockchain technology that can help us and change the blockchain but most of these are centralized protocols even where it is never disclosed what they do with the proceeds raised.

Venture capital is investing in projects in startups with big ideas with low capitalization to seek to surprise or be a new market gem.

Now, protocols like DIG, which have decentralization as their main economic idea are looking to re-invest part of their profits in order to manage venture capital not for companies, but for potential startups that focus on the development of blockchain technology."""|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|716899|public|self|Venture capital to fund new blockchain developments|0|[]|0.5|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/sbugma/venture_capital_to_fund_new_blockchain/|all_ads|6|1643033312.0|369b4874-6c3d-11e9-9795-0af0e0456bf4|dark||||||||||||||||2022-01-24 19:38:32+00:00|t3_sbugma|0|0||

Since users will basically have access to any DeFi service, through one ecosystem that will be considered the backbone of Blockchain. 

And pNetwork is aiming to do exactly that through its decentralized ecosystem that consists of products and services that eliminate barriers between blockchains, unleash the full potential of DeFi dApps, and ensure liquidity across multiple decentralized ecosystems. 

So basically, DeFi investors, along with other market participants, can get access to a variety of dApp or yield farming options even if they hold Bitcoin, Litecoin, or other digital assets that reside on blockchain networks that are not supporting smart contracts at all."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|716895|public|self|We should be working on bringing blockchains together to accelerate mass adoption|0|[]|0.86|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/sbu6gi/we_should_be_working_on_bringing_blockchains/|all_ads|6|1643032610.0|369b4874-6c3d-11e9-9795-0af0e0456bf4|dark||||||||||||||||2022-01-24 19:26:50+00:00|t3_sbu6gi|0|10||
