You may profit from your bitcoin investment if you do it correctly. Here’s how to do it.  
Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was dismissed as a passing craze in 2009. While the blockchain technology underpinning Bitcoin impressed the tech community, it failed to pique the public’s attention as a viable investment choice. After more than a decade, many new cryptocurrencies have joined the crypto market, with Bitcoin emerging as the most valuable. Investing in cryptocurrencies is on the minds of all investors right now. People who acquired cryptocurrencies before the price boom in 2017 are reaping the rewards of their best financial decision.

## So, are you ready to begin your bitcoin investment journey?

### 1. Begin small

Like the stock market, the crypto market is very volatile, which means values will fluctuate wildly. Therefore, it is only prudent to invest in cryptocurrencies after ensuring that you have sufficient liquid cash to last at least six months without incurring any obligations. Once you’ve figured this out, start investing in stocks (if you haven’t previously) to gauge your risk tolerance. Set aside a portion of the money to invest in cryptocurrencies once you’ve proven you can manage the ups and downs. Limit your investment to 5-10% of your income if at all feasible.

### 2. Decide on a Cryptocurrency

Yes, there are many cryptocurrencies on the market at the moment, each with a distinct pricing point. However, it is not advised to jump on the bandwagon and invest in five different tiny cryptocurrencies. To choose the best cryptocurrency, you’ll need to do a lot of research. Keep an eye on what’s going on in the market, compile a list of the top five performing cryptocurrencies, and track their progress. Bitcoin is now the world’s largest cryptocurrency and the most trustworthy, ahead of Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Binance Coin. Here’s why this is the most crucial step in your investment process. Many cryptocurrencies that entered the market in the last decade have either plateaued or vanished altogether. It means that your $100 investment might turn into a big fat zero in the blink of an eye.

### 3. Select the Most Appropriate Cryptocurrency Exchange

It’s essentially a marketplace where you can buy, sell, and store your crypto assets. Analytics Insight has compiled a comprehensive list of the best cryptocurrency exchanges, complete with transaction costs, benefits, and drawbacks. These crypto exchanges are primarily intended to manage cryptocurrency, similar to how banks and other financial institutions lend money, keep money, and issue mortgages.

### 4. Select a Wallet for Cryptocurrency

What is the definition of a cryptocurrency wallet?  
It’s a piece of software that holds your private and public keys and serves as a connection between you and the blockchain, which houses your crypto assets. Many people mistake crypto wallets for cryptocurrency storage. However, they allow you to access your cryptocurrency on the blockchain via a crypto address known as the key. A crypto transaction cannot be completed without the key. During the changeover, you can send and receive bitcoins with any firm that takes cryptocurrencies as payment. You’re ready to invest in cryptocurrencies if you follow the instructions above. Prepare yourself for some volatility, regardless of the cryptocurrency you buy-in, and monitor the price frequently.

### A few benefits of crypto trading

### Low investment threshold

Because cryptocurrencies are divisible, you may acquire smaller portions, providing a shallow investment requirement. As a result, almost everyone has access to the capacity to trade.

### Liquidity

Because cryptocurrency exchanges are open 24 hours a day, you may purchase, trade, and sell your assets at any time.

### Transparency

The bulk of crypto tractions are recorded using blockchain technology, which provides trustworthiness, transparency, traceability, and unalterable data.

### Diversification of assets

Traders can reduce or limit risk by spreading their holdings among a wide range of cryptocurrencies.

### Costs

Cryptocurrencies have considerably lower fees than stock trading or other traditional asset types.

### Steps to Investing in Cryptocurrencies

### Step 1: Open an account with a cryptocurrency brokerage

Create an account with a crypto brokerage. You’ll need to supply personally-identifying information, just like you would with a stock brokerage. When creating an account, you’ll need to give your Social Security number, address, date of birth, and email address, among other things.

### Step 2: Add money to your account

You’ll need to connect your bank account once you’ve joined up with a crypto brokerage. The majority of cryptocurrency exchanges accept bank deposits via debit cards and wire transfers. Wire transfers are usually the most cost-effective way to fill your account, and they’re accessible on [Coinbase](http://www.coinbase.com/) and [Nabobtrade](http://www.nabobtrade.com/).

Some of them choose not to but most of them do not know about staking. So here I am, doing my best to explain what is staking. TLDR at the bottom.

**What is staking?**

In order to remain decentralized, operating without a central authority, cryptocurrency networks work by incorporating a consensus mechanism, which means all computers on that network can agree on what's going on at any given time without a central bank intermediary.

This means everyone's computer can agree on which transactions have taken place, for example, instead of a bank keeping track of it.

**How does staking work?**

* When the minimum balance is met, a node deposits that amount of cryptocurrency into the network as a stake (similar to a security deposit). 
* The size of a stake is directly proportional to the chances of that node being chosen to forge the next block. 
* If the node successfully creates a block, the validator receives a reward, similar to how a miner is rewarded in proof-of-work chains. 
* Validators lose part of their stake if they double-sign or attempt to attack the network

**Why do only some cryptocurrencies have staking?**

This is where it starts to get more technical. Bitcoin, for instance, doesn’t allow staking. To understand why you need a little bit of background. 

* Cryptocurrencies are typically decentralized, meaning there is no central authority running the show. So how do all the computers in a decentralized network arrive at the correct answer without having it fed to them by a central authority like a bank or a credit-card company? They use a “consensus mechanism.” 
* Many cryptocurrencies — including Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0 — use a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work. Via Proof of Work, the network throws a huge amount of processing power at solving problems like validating transactions between strangers on opposite sides of the planet and making sure nobody is trying to spend the same money twice. Part of the process involves “miners” all over the world competing to be the first to solve a cryptographic puzzle. The winner earns the right to add the latest “block” of verified transactions onto the blockchain — and receives some crypto in return. 

For a relatively simple blockchain like Bitcoin’s (which functions a lot like a bank’s ledger, tracking incoming and outgoing transactions) Proof of Work is a scalable solution. But for something more complex like Ethereum — which has a huge variety of applications including the whole world of DeFi running on *top* of the blockchain — Proof of Work can cause bottlenecks when there’s too much activity. As a result transaction times can be longer and fees can be higher.

**What are the advantages of staking?**

Many long-term crypto holders look at staking as a way of making their assets work for them by generating rewards, rather than collecting dust in their crypto wallets.

Staking has the added benefit of contributing to the security and efficiency of the blockchain projects you support. By staking some of your funds, you make the blockchain more resistant to attacks and strengthen its ability to process transactions. (Some projects also award “governance tokens” to staking participants, which give holders a say in future changes and upgrades to that protocol.)

**What are some staking risks?**

Staking often requires a lockup or “vesting” period, where your crypto can’t be transferred for a certain period of time. This can be a drawback, as you won’t be able to trade staked tokens during this period even if prices shift. Before staking, it is important to research the specific staking requirements and rules for each project you are looking to get involved with.

**How do I start staking?**

Staking is generally open to anyone who wants to participate. That said, becoming a full validator can require a substantial minimum investment (ETH2, for example, requires a minimum of 32 ETH), technical knowledge, and a dedicated computer that can perform validations day or night without downtime. Participating on this level comes with security considerations and is a serious obligation, as downtime can cause a validator’s stake to become slashed.

But for the vast majority of participants, there’s a simpler way to participate. Via exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Crypto.com and many more you can contribute an amount you can afford to a staking pool. This lowers the barrier to entry and allows investors to start earning rewards without having to operate their own validator hardware.

***TLDR: Staking involves the locking up of assets to participate in the validation of transactions on proof-of-stake blockchains, with a financial “reward” provided in exchange. This offers a digital asset alternative for yield generation in today's low or negative interest rate environment.***

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” 

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. 

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp)

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each ADA coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi today.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, which is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa and so on. 

Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code for free.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 100 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 18,752,887 BTC out there at a cost of $34,133.52

That means, the market cap is $34,133.52 x 18,752,887 = $640,102,043,472.24

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 31,946,328,269. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 121B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more.

At a price is $1.35 that means the market cap for Cardano is $1.35 X 31,946,328,269 = $43,092,275,957 (43B)

DOGE coin, has no supply limit. Currently there are 130,383,034,336 (130B) of them. They make 10K new coins a minute, forever.

You’ll need 135B market cap to reach a 1-dollar DOGE.

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 1.41 Trillion. That’s only 0.12% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

[https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:\~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth](https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth).

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they ""buy the dip,"" to ""average down."" Some ""Dollar Cost Average (DCA)"" which is commonly confused with averaging down. But here they buy on cadence, say 10 dollars every Monday, regards of price. 

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What are things to look out for?**

**Do your own research**. There are now more then 4K types of crypto currencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps.

There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, it’s a Ponzi scheme.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With things like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens are the first versions of Smart contracts. 

But you really need to break them into two parts.   
The NFT and the Asset.   
The token is written to the blockchain and never changes, but only represents metadata around the asset.   
The asset is the digital file. Today for the most part that is art. But it can be ANY FILE for a million different uses cases   
The asset, is NOT stored in the blockchain. Its stored, if you're lucky, in an IPFS server.

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

The new financial landscape and continued uncertainty have accelerated the shift away from traditional financial institutions.

As the economy attempts to roar into high gear from a standing start, the world of cryptocurrency has taken to the main stage. It has cemented itself as a recognized asset class by major asset managers, investment banks and hedge funds. As the speed of mainstream adoption continues to take the financial world by storm, it is also paving the way for investors to explore a new frontier — crypto options.

What are options?

Options are financial contracts that allow investors to buy or sell the underlying asset, at a set price, at a future date. This allows investors to take directional bets on the price movement of an asset. Investors that expect the asset to appreciate in value can purchase call options from which they will profit if the market price of the asset exceeds the strike price. Contrarily, if they believe the asset will depreciate in value, they can purchase put options, which will bring in profit when the market price of the asset falls below the strike price. 

When these conditions are met, investors can choose to exercise their option, requiring the issuer to buy or sell the underlying asset from or to the investor at the strike price. Or, they can simply trade their options to others to realize a profit.

Truth about options-

There are several features inherent to options that make them more palatable to investors, especially in a volatile market. With options, investors are able to gain exposure to larger positions at a fraction of the cost. For example, consider buying 100 shares of a stock at $50. In order to be in this position, an investor would need to have $5,000 in capital. With options, however, the cost can be significantly reduced. The same investor can gain the same exposure to a stock or cryptocurrency by buying an option for a fraction of the cost, say with a $150 premium.

Options are a powerful tool in empowering investors to capitalize on the volatility of the markets and enable investors to participate in the markets while freeing up capital, allowing them to diversify their strategy and take on a larger number of positions.

Options also allow investors to gain exposure to the market volatility. Since the price of an option is directly correlated to the market volatility, options tend to get more expensive in a volatile market. Thus, an investor holding a long position in an options contract stands to gain from the market volatility too.

The biggest use case for options, however, is their usage as risk management products. Investors can buy put options (or bet against the market) in order to hedge their portfolio when they are uncertain about market upside. This is like buying insurance on your portfolio in order to protect it from market volatility or down-moves.

Institutional frenzy for options and crypto

As institutional interest continues to grow for the cryptocurrency markets, so has institutional appetite for crypto options. Strategic investors have found refuge in the idea that options allow them to capitalize on the volatility of crypto markets to capture high profits while at the same time keeping them away from higher-risk investments. The volatile nature of crypto markets creates an urgent need for investors to be able to diversify their strategies and hedge their positions while still getting exposure to the upside. 

Options markets have given investors a chance to play the field, invest strategically and study the market. Even during what some are calling a bear market, this has kept activity high.

The buck doesn’t stop at institutions

The power that options offer for individuals is being realized by an increasing number of retail investors too, even in the midst of global economic uncertainty. According to Trade Alert, 2020 was a record year for the options market in terms of volume traded, with 7.47 billion contracts traded. This trend continued with conviction into early 2021. 

Surprisingly, most of the increase in volume was contributed by retail investors. An article by Barron’s highlighted that options brokers such as Schwab have seen a 116% increase in options being traded. It is estimated that 60% of all options being traded are from retail investors, evidenced by the position size being less than 10 contracts. In fact, the number of single contract trades has doubled in the same time period.

As we progress through 2021, major names such as Goldman Sachs have also announced expanding their crypto presence by offering options trading in Ether (ETH) after seeing huge institutional demand. These products will also apply to their retail customers and are sure to reduce some of the leverage in the system, creating an easy onramp for investors.


Innovations

Today, centralized exchanges are better equipped to handle retail demand for options. They don’t suffer from network congestion experienced on Ethereum, leading to instant execution of trades with lower fees.

That doesn’t rule out the innovations that come with the accelerated rate of decentralized finance. DeFi has disrupted many traditional financial industries, and it is looking to make options more readily available. Decentralized exchanges will play a key role, in the future, in connecting retail investors to options as its ecosystem continues to evolve. 

With the economic impact of the global pandemic expected to last until 2025, cryptocurrency markets will, without a doubt, remain volatile. DeFi applications and centralized exchanges are diligently working towards bringing more and more cryptocurrencies to the options market and evolving to simplify complicated trading strategies for investors."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3210372|public|self|Cryptocurrency has cemented itself as a recognized asset class by major asset managers, investment banks and hedge funds.|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ohijn5/cryptocurrency_has_cemented_itself_as_a/|all_ads|6|1625903290.0|FINANCE|709d50a8-1deb-11e4-9b08-12313b0b24aa|FINANCE|||||||||||2021-07-10 13:18:10+00:00|t3_ohijn5|0|15|0.86||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]|||False|||||||||||||||10_07_21|07_21|0.11076456|0.4499968|0.43923864|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07071885466575623|0.20293867588043213|0.01466779038310051|0.2337827980518341|0.4597536027431488|0.018138350918889046

Well, I’m not sure if people realize how much money is about to come flowing to families starting July 15th.  $300 for each 5 and under child and $250 for each 6-17 year old.  Per month.  And then as soon as 2022 is here, families will get six months of that, all rolled in to their tax returns.  Keep in mind for a family with 2 kids that’s something in the 6k range total.  4 kids? 12k.  You get the idea.

Wages are soaring, prices are rising (I work in retail, prices are going up every week across -tons- of items.  And with that comes more fear of holding the dollar.

I'm new to all this but I think this is probably something basic that I'm just overlooking.

I got all my coins/tokens off binance and into my offline wallet for safety reasons, but I enjoyed looking at the metrics there with all my investments. Is there a good website that allows you to see charts but also allow you to manually input what you own and mark when you bought them to see how your investment is going? I've been using TradingView but I'm quite overwhelmed and not sure if free users would be able to do this on there.

Long story short; I’m a football (soccer) player. I’m very fortunate to be able to have the opportunities I have and to finally begin travel once again. The past year or two, I’ve been stuck in the US (where I was born) traveling and playing. I didn’t know where the current pandemic was going to lead me to for playing opportunities. Finally, an opportunity has opened up for me in an Asian country. This is just a trial, so I could end up there to live and play or I could get bounced around as i travel for other trials or be back home. 

What happens to my crypto? I use Coinbase and Voyager as my exchanges and where my crypto is held (I do not have a large amount that would make sense to travel to a wallet at this time). I am planning to hold my crypto for at least 3-5 years.. but would like to continue to grow my positions in both portfolios. If i keep my current phone, will i be able to access these exchanges or will I be locked out as it’ll notice my location? Will i need to open a new exchange, buy the crypto and then send it to my CB wallet to then transfer to my CB exchange? 

If it helps, I’ll be traveling to India first where the hopes will be to sign my professional contract. I would just like to continue growing my portfolio and not have to wait till god-knows-when I’ll be back in the states or a European country that i can access these exchanges."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3210263|public|self|What happens next for my Crypto and my future?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ohhn25/what_happens_next_for_my_crypto_and_my_future/|all_ads|6|1625899570.0|SUPPORT||SUPPORT|||||||||||2021-07-10 12:16:10+00:00|t3_ohhn25|0|5|0.73||1||[]|False|False|[]||||[]|||False|||||||||||||||10_07_21|07_21|0.09943512|0.50272423|0.39784065|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0823168158531189|0.11424129456281662|0.01224549487233162|0.49923110008239746|0.2819773554801941|0.009987949393689632

So I could compare it to my experience with BSC/PancakeSwap and ETH/UniSwap. 

This was meant just as an experiment so I didnt plan on holding my assets on Polygon but just get a feel for Matic's network speed and overall UX.

In order to do that I had to first buy the FISH token to use on polycat since it does not have a native swap feature. I had two options:

1. Create a Hotbit account : too much hassle, will need KYC and I already use Binance
2. Use QuickSwap : The Polygon equivalent of UniSwap

Here are the steps I had to go through:

1. Buy $100 USDT on Binance
2. Pay $10 network fee to send USDT to metamask.
3. I know have $90
4. Go to the Matic Bridge to convert the ERC20 USDT to Matic USDT
5. I need Matic to pay the gas
6. Thankfully, get small amount of free matic at the matic faucet
7. Go back to the matic bridge
8. Switch ERC20 USDT to Matic USDT
9. I need ETH to pay the gas fee
10. Go back to Binance and buy $30 of ETH
11. Pay $3 to send ETH to metamask
12. I know have $27 of ETH
13. Go back to the bridge, pay $5 ETH to approve the bridge and switch USDT to Matic
14. Takes 15 minutes for confirmation (I thought Matic was a scaling solution!!!???)
15. Finally, go to quickswap
16. Swap USDT for FISH, pay Matic gas fee
17. My USDT is now worth $87 for some reason 🙄
18. Go to [polygon.finance](https://polygon.finance) 
19. Pay Matic gas fee to approve staking contract (takes 5 minutes)
20. Try to stake FISH
21. Insufficient Matic Gas 😭
22. Go back to Matic faucet
23. It refuses to give me more free matic as it thinks I still have enough
24. Hmm, now I need to drain my matic
25. Go back to [polygon.finance](https://polygon.finance)
26. Approve a random staking contract, pay small gas fee
27. Go back to matic faucet, it now sends me some more free matic
28. Go back to [polygon.finance](https://polygon.finance)
29. Stake the FISH finally, takes 5 minutes to approve

&amp;#x200B;

Now I want to sell my FISH tokens and send the money back to my Binance account:

1. Go to [polygon.finance](https://polygon.finance)
2. Unstake FISH
3. Need to pay matic gas fee
4. Takes 5 minutes to approve
5. Go to quickswap to sell my matic for USDT
6. I now have $83 of USDT 🤣
7. Go to Matic bridge so I can convert the USDT to ERC20 USDT (so I can send it to Binance)
8. I need to pay $7 ETH to approve the bridging (takes 5 minutes to approve)
9. Now send transfer the USDT to my metamask
10. That will be another $5 ETH
11. I know have $15 of ETH down from $30
12. Takes 40 minutes to bridge the USDT from Matic network to ETH (scaling solution 🤣)\*\*\*
13. Now I want to send the USDT from my metamask to Binance
14. That will be another $4 in ETH gas fees please
15. I'm now down to $11 in ETH

So I started with $100 USDT and $30 ETH and am now down to $83 of USDT and $11 ETH for what was basically 2 cross chain swaps and 1 dex swap.

I've been mostly using the Binance Smart Chain since I have a Binance account. I also use the Binance Wallet extension mostly instead of Metamask. Honestly I've had about $30 of BNB and it's lasted 2 months and I'm quite a frequent user.

Also in my experience a transaction on the BSC is settled in seconds if not minutes and there is very very little friction in the entire experience. Contrasted with my experience using ETH and Matic it's really horrible tbh.

Just to be clear I know this would be slightly easier if I used Hotbit but I don't want to go through the process of creating another exchange account and all the KYC rigamarole.

I thought Matic was supposed to be scaling solution and although the fess are low (or free thanks to the faucet) the actual network itself was terribly slow for me, even slower than the Ethereum chain which is really saying something.

Overall, I do feel quite jaded with my experience and the cynic in me says that all these blockchains are just competing for transaction fees and trying to make money by some kind of arbitrage as opposed to providing a cheap and frictionless user experience. And I know things were much worse on Ethereum a month ago.

Looking at the current state of the American/world economy, it seems to me that we are on the brink of drastic inflation, possibly even hyperinflation. If hyperinflation hits and we see 20%-50%+ increases in prices month over month, and the dollar gets massively devalued, what do you think this will do for the crypto industry? Will more people be dumping their savings into it to hedge against the hyperinflation? 

In my personal opinion, in a few months we will see prices like never before on goods and services. People will see this warning as a sign of things to come. Smart investors will start taking everything out of fiat currencies and putting it into crypto/gold/silver/property to protect themselves. The dollar and current financial system will collapse and will be replaced by the futuristic blockchain system. It’s a perfect storm imo.

“Hi,

Thanks for your patience. I wanted to provide you with an update on the process for bank deposits. 

Due to updated regulatory guidance, our banking partner is mandating enhanced verification procedures for all future bank transactions. 

All customers will be required to provide a photo of the front and back of their ID in order to conduct further bank transactions (deposit, or withdraw). 

Because this mandate is based on regulatory guidance and comes directly from our banking partner, we do not have the flexibility or the ability to override the requirement for you.

If you have already provided both the front and back of your ID, it is likely that no further action is needed from you at this time (we will reach out if there was an issue validating the images). However, if you have previously only provided the front of your photo ID during the verification process, you would need to upload it again now with front and back due to the new requirements.

We are in the process of rolling out updates to our mobile applications to allow providing front and back of ID. In the meantime you can utilize our website portal:
https://dashboard.anchorusd.com/register/image

Once you have provided your updated photo ID, bank deposits will begin processing again normally early next week (July 13th). We appreciate your patience.

Best,
Team AnchorUSD”

I come to you with a cry for help.

As you just read in the title, I have an idea for a blockchain-based, crypto-related platform and, for what it’s worth, I think it’s a nice one. But, unfortunately, I don’t have any technical background. 
I am an Italian student of modern languages (linguistics, literature, translation… that stuff) and my understanding of blockchains, cryptocurrencies and so on is limited to “user level” (or just beyond that because I am a bit of a nerd).

Now, I’ve been thinking about this idea for several weeks and I think it could actually be successful and innovative, if done right. I won’t disclose the details, but it involves a marketplace of NFTs and smart contracts. I know it sounds boring and cliché at this point, but, to my knowledge, there’s nothing quite like it in the crypto space a the moment.

So… what do I do to give my idea a shot?
I am 100% sure and aware that I couldn’t do this by myself in a million years and I don’t have the money to have people build it for me. All I have is an idea and a vision for it.

Should I forget about this? Should I “sell” my idea to someone? (Is that even possibile?)

If one used their regular bank account and purchased some coins years ago, said coins have rocketed and now that person wants to use those coins to buy a house for example, you can find a real estate broker who accepts crypto or you can sell into fiat but then you have a paper trail and will be liable for CGT pretty much everywhere, am I right? 

What about those transactions from years ago, could the authorities question you on where the funds are now? 

In other words, what will be the most efficient/discreet way of enjoying crypto gains with tax avoidance. 

P.S I am not asking about tax evasion, I pay my taxes."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3210357|public|self|Can the government trace my crypto?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ohifen/can_the_government_trace_my_crypto/|all_ads|6|1625902815.0|PRIVACY|fee6c918-f3e4-11e5-8172-0ecf7e00c6db|PRIVACY|||||||||||2021-07-10 13:10:15+00:00|t3_ohifen|0|2|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]|||False|||||||||||||||10_07_21|07_21|0.11076456|0.4499968|0.43923864|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07071885466575623|0.20293867588043213|0.01466779038310051|0.2337827980518341|0.4597536027431488|0.018138350918889046

I tried claiming them but it was stuck loading, like it has previously so I put it down to a lot of traffic, assuming they had just gone out to everyone so decided to leave it til today. So I checked back just now and not only did they not go into my vault but the button to claim them had gone completely. 

Does this mean I have missed my moons for this distribution or something? Or has anyone had anything similar happen?

I’ve been in crypto for over a year but I have not explored the decentralized world as much as I would like to and am only just now getting my feet wet.

I discovered decentraland this morning and was blown away by the concept. The visuals and the game itself are somewhat underwhelming (I’ve only played about 5 mins and it is still very early in development), but the concept is absolutely incredible.

The whole thing reminds me of Ready Player One and the early Everquest days back in the late 90s early 2000s. I admit, I’m in love and I am going to do everything in my power to resist dropping a stupid amount of money into this.

When looking at the r/decentraland subreddit I ran across somebody mentioning starlink token. Had never heard of it.

I went and looked at the web page and this inspired me to do MY VERY FIRST UNISWAP! Which I have to say costed a ridiculous amount with how much I was trying to purchase.

I started small because I’m new to defi and swapping and there is a high risk of my cash going poof so I started with $10 in ETH. I used the coinbase wallet to do uniswap because that was the easiest for me to figure out. My $10 ETH then turned into about $5 of STARL. 

Then I decided to experiment a bit further and see if I could put that STARL on my ledger wallet since it’s an ETH20 token. In ledger live there wasn’t any option to add that token so I said f**k it and sent $0.50 to my ETH ledger address to see what would happen. That transaction cost another $2. Meh.. whatever.

Pretty sure that STARL is gone forever! Lol. Didn’t show up in my ledger wallet.

This whole thing is pretty damn cool though. I would love to have a decentralized space game! Has anybody else heard of this token? It looks like it went live on accident? Anybody else excited for it? Does anybody have any tips on getting better at using uniswap or whether I can put these obscure tokens on my ledger?

So excited for the future.

I always dreamed that one day I'll make my own Crypto Currency and after so many ups and downs I was able to make my own Crypto Coin (QZK) which is based on the blockchain technology of LTC, I had to face a lot of complications in this journey and I wanted to share my personal experience up till now about some of the struggles I had to face in this journey.

The idea had always been in my mind. I am the founder of a private limited payment gateway company based in the United Kingdom (Qazeek.com) , we are a complete Paypal solution for countries where Paypal is not officially available. The idea for the QzkCoin came due to all the complications I had to personally see while working with Paypal and how it was regulated, and paypal would just take our account as hostage and put limits on it for no apparent reason and would also put permanent bans. This at times would get really stressful, other than my fascination for Crypto in general, this was yet another reason we introduced our own crypto currency because I didn't enjoy that our accounts were being taken as hostage left and right.

I had literally zero knowledge about blockchain technology, though I had the budget and I was able to outsource most of the part of our development work to Blockchain developers in the United States. Our coin ""QZK'' is based on the LTC technology and our developers did coding in such a way that it has faster transaction times and at the same time being just as secure and keeping you anonymous. I know nowadays it's very easy to make your own tokens (some in 15-20 minutes) but I decided that I should have the algorithm written and adjusted to our preference so that we are able to modify it in ways we would like and make it in the ways it would suit our needs.

Secondly the total cost for this project until now is 22K USD which is increasing on a daily basis as we have to spend a lot on marketing and getting coin listed on various exchanges, and after continuously working day and night it took me a total of 1 and a half months to get done with the project completely where afterwards we can move towards the phase of marketing and getting it listed on several exchanged and proving to people that hence this is yet not another scam coin, because trust me I know I have worked so hard on this and I hear this a lot that this is going to be a scam and that you're going to fail but I don't let that bother me at all and I will prove one day to everyone who has been hating on me and trying to call this a scam that its not and it's a totally legitimate coin. We've even had facebook take down our pages probably because I feel like Facebook has this notion that all the newly launched crypto currencies are just a scam.

I personally believe that it's not that hard to have your own coin set up, literally anyone can watch a youtube tutorial and create your own tokens, it's just that simple. The hard part about having your own crypto coin is the marketing part and the competition is just so intense and in moments it might feel like that you're going to be crushed by a competitor and honestly these thoughts haunt me a lot but I don't let it make me go down and give up. My budget allowed me to outsource stuff I wasn't familiar with so that helped me alot and saved me a lot of time but despite me being able to outsource it, managing these tasks were not easy at all and it's really stressful to manage a team and make sure everything goes smoothly.
It took us a lot of effort but we were able to finally get approval for a exchange company and hopefully our coin is going live on 15 JULY on Koin Bazaar.
There might be a lot of people who'd say why didn't you work with existing and established cryptocurrencies already, that was because I wanted to go through the process of making my own coin and this is something which has always fascinated me so much and I wanted to take on the risk and try to make my own crypto currency and hopefully one day get listed on Binance.

The reason I wrote this post was because I wanted to personally vent out and talk about my personal experience of trying to make a crypto currency coin. Its hard but its not impossible and it required A LOT of budget probably hundreds and millions of dollars in order to launch one successful crypto coin, and I hope that one day I am able to make it to my goal of getting our coin listed on Binance and all the credible exchanges and the QZK coin is somewhere between the top coins, (I know its pretty hard and nearly impossible, but I believe that one should always dream big if they want to get somewhere in life)

If anyone has any tips which they'd like to share with me please do. I am also open to answering any questions you might have. We have also made a community if you'd like to join or stay updated about this coin at r/qzkcoin."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3211637|public|self|I made my own Cryptocurrency and I am currently on the journey for its marketing trying to beat the heavy competition 🚀|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ohqwx8/i_made_my_own_cryptocurrency_and_i_am_currently/|all_ads|6|1625931375.0|SELF-STORY|c301e03e-5ea6-11e8-8824-0efe9c7bcaa8|SELF-STORY|||||||||||2021-07-10 21:06:15+00:00|t3_ohqwx8|0|0|0.5||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]|||False|||||||||||||||10_07_21|07_21|0.11373047|0.41845116|0.46781844|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.04209398850798607|0.06655336916446686|0.0036040658596903086|0.8177513480186462|0.06688778847455978|0.0031094748992472887

With more unknown, low market cap market pairs, there's a pragmatic limit to how much one can expect to invest in.

Rather than right now, I'm looking at historical data (candlesticks being the only data points available). Every exchange returns at least OHLC, timestamp and transacted volume, and some also provide other things, like volume by taker/seller, trade count and ""turnover"".

What's the best educated guess I can make as to with how much one could have filled a buy limit order based on candlestick data? Note that there's no order book, and no ""median order amount"".

You have to seek wealth.

Wealth is having assets that earn money for you passively.

Money is a means of how you transfer your time and wealth.

If you don’t come from a rich family, you will have to begin your journey of pursuing early retirement by trading time for money, which means you have to have some kind of a high-income skill that allows you to make a steady income.

Every time you cash in your paycheck, you have to max out your allocation into assets, which are investments that earn you money while you sleep.


Most people won’t be able to invest most of their capital in assets because they enjoy partying or buying fancy cars (liabilities) when they’re young.

But remember, if you do what everyone else does, you’ll get what everyone else gets, which is 40–50 years of slaving away at a dead-end 9-to-5 job, only to retire and enjoy your freedom in your most feeble years of life. I mean, who knows how long you’ll even live…

Don’t forget… assets generate income for you while you sleep, meaning when you have enough of these assets to cover for your living + enjoyment expenses, you no longer have to trade your time for money.

This is the beauty of assets… they break you free from having to trade your time (the most valuable resource) for money.

While this may be painful in the short term, I believe being content with living below your means is one of the most underrated advantages you have when it comes to financial planning.

When you have assets generating you passive income, you can use the capital you get from those assets to allocate into even more assets, and on goes the cycle for the gradual elimination of your dead-end 9-to-5 job."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3211502|public|self|things you can do to retire early- assets generate income for you|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ohpvoi/things_you_can_do_to_retire_early_assets_generate/|all_ads|6|1625927881.0|STRATEGY|efdba982-5d89-11e8-9598-0ee79d121028|STRATEGY|||||||||||2021-07-10 20:08:01+00:00|t3_ohpvoi|0|1|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]|||False|||||||||||||||10_07_21|07_21|0.13241875|0.48861924|0.378962|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.06887347251176834|0.13158805668354034|0.01260214764624834|0.5141336917877197|0.26247766613960266|0.010325027629733086

I’ve only recently decided to invest in ETH and I’d like to transfer it of   Binance. I haven’t bought a cold wallet yet but planning to, so I thought it would be good to check what the community thinks. I’m absolutely dreading transferring it into the void, so I wanted to ask what’s the easiest and safest way to transfer ETH, even if it comes at the cost of higher fees? Also, how and where can I check the gas fees? Lastly, what are your tips to avoid stupid mistakes like selecting the wrong network?

- **Secondly**, these people will also be able to transfer this currency between themselves, between countries and to other countries without the need of a centralised banking system to register.  The fees will also be massively reduced for remittances, so loved ones abroad can help these people much easier without ripoff fees like from western union. 
- **Thirdly**, Credit. These people will now be able to apply for credit from the thousands of individuals and decentralised financial apps that are offering it. They can make a claim (i.e seeds to grow tomatoes), and people can choose whether or not to offer the finance for it. These people will no longer be restricted from gaining access to small loans, creating businesses, helping Africa thrive and bettering themselves. I explect this eventually may extend to education loans and grants too. the future is long.

- **Fourthy** - Making a voting system, that is both transparent and immutable. A way to stop potential corrupt practices that are reported around the globe and help all countries have a true depiction of what is going on.

Many of these systems are still in the making, but we can see the wonderful vision Charles has for the future of Cardano, it is genuinely a tool for good, giving power and financial freedom to those that have never had access to it before. Whats more, all of this is based on blockchain tech. Even if Cardano hits a lull in value, I still support it because of the beauty of what they are trying to achieve."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3211355|public|self|Why I think Cardano (ADA) truly needs a round of applause|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ohp1qh/why_i_think_cardano_ada_truly_needs_a_round_of/|all_ads|6|1625925144.0|STRATEGY|efdba982-5d89-11e8-9598-0ee79d121028|STRATEGY|||||||||||2021-07-10 19:22:24+00:00|t3_ohp1qh|0|20|0.58||7||[]|False|False|[]||||[]|||False|||||||||||||||10_07_21|07_21|0.09943512|0.50272423|0.39784065|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0823168158531189|0.11424129456281662|0.01224549487233162|0.49923110008239746|0.2819773554801941|0.009987949393689632

I have a foolproof system. 

I have been trading crypto for about five years now and consider myself an expert. 

Are we ready 

1- when the market is doing well, and the coin is at its highest Buy, for example I purchased Ethereum when the price was about $3,500. 

2- sell then the price is low, so I just sold my Ether and made a significant loss. 

Remember boys and girls; the equation is straightforward and foolproof:

BUY HIGH AND SELL LOW

I still have to manually clean up some stuff but by and large—it’s not bad for the low low cost of absolutely FREE!

If you’re a heavy trader, probably better to use the $150 or $200 services. But if you’re lower volume as I’m sure the vast majority of us are, it might just be a good fit for you.

Although I still probably wouldn't be considered ""rich"" by most people, I'm currently up a good 12000% and the only time I ever made a small withdrawal was to buy a house that I never thought I'd be able to afford.

But in that same time I've also seen countless friends, colleagues and even family members dip their toes into the crypto waters, only to get washed away by various trading schemes and end up losing it all. Because though there are certainly some traders out there who are able to make much more than me from hodling, the simple fact is that the large majority of everyone who tries ends up failing. The numbers vary from different surveys, but some claim that as much as 95% of all traders actually lose money.

That's not very good odds. 

Still, I keep seeing people resort to the same old argument that ""Bitcoin is sooooo expensive now. It's not like it was 7 years ago... It can't keep going up forever..."" 

But the thing is: that's exactly what people said back in 2014.

So that's why I always recommend hodling, as the numbers prove it's going to be the most successful strategy for almost all of us. 

Though it might not always be as easy as it sounds, so if you want to learn about some common pitfalls and how to overcome them, I've made a short video where I talk a little bit more in detail about it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQEDegj6zaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQEDegj6zaw)

2 types of volatility — external volatility (aka market) and implied volatility (aka internal). They are useful factors when understanding your assets.

**Factors Beyond Volatility**

Volatility is not the only thing you should care about when looking at your (crypto) assets. Also note the other data and factors.

* Micro Economy: Inflation of assets
* Macro Ecosystem: Market Conditions. Market could change and that affects the assets.
* Past Data: Beyond micro and macro markets it's also good to look at historical data to look at past data to get some reference and understanding. Note: *Past data does not define future performance*

**Historical Volatility vs Implied Volatility**

There are two types of volatility. One is the market volatility and the other is implied volatility. In a very simple way it's basically historical volatility and future volatility.

**Historical volatility:** It is based on past data and on all the information that is already given.

**Future volatility:** It is based on people's expectations of the assets and here you calculate based on how people pay for the expected assets.

**Higher Volatility = Higher Risk**

The general notion about volatility is that higher volatility = high risk.

Sometimes it is called educated gambling or educated speculation but **it's not always true**. The general notion of higher volatility means that the price will move more and when the prices move more, higher risk will be experienced. But it really depends on the trading strategy because that will help to mitigate different risks as when you have something with high volatility you can do something else to try and offset the risk or try to reduce that risk.

# What is Market Volatility?

&gt;It's a statistical measure of how ""spread"" is the value from the middle average. More spread (like a pancake) means higher volatility. Less spread (like a mountain) means lower volatilty.

1. **Uses Past Data:** It's historical volatility or using past data to get some understanding of where the asset is right now.
2. **Fluctuation of Returns:** It is the fluctuation (movement) of the returns of the prices of the assets. It is measured by measuring the spread of the returns so you can think of it as two bell curves. One bell curve is flat so almost like a very low middle line and it spreads out very widely like a pancake. You have another bell curve like the Mount Everest so it has a very high peak and everything is very narrow towards the peak.
3. **Higher Volatility:** Volatility is the spread of the value of the assets so when it's more pancake shape (i.e. when the sides are more spread out into different directions) that's where it's more volatile. Because there are more ways the spread could go.  
Whereas if it's higher like a mountain (i.e. when it's very narrow towards the center ), then there is low volatility because the prices won't change so much and it's all within a very constrained range.

**Why do we care?**

These values give us two main information:

1. **Market sentiment:** It is something like the better volatility where we try to figure out what the market is thinking about and how it compares to other assets
2. **Historical spot price:** It is how the asset itself is doing

My story isn't one of acquiring life changing wealth, nor is it meant to be a sob-story, more-so a thank you to the community.

My life has been constant and consistent turmoil since childhood. I was raised a single child, born to a drug addicted mother and raised by my abusive single father. The environment I matured in was not conducive to manifesting thoughts of success or planning for my future, but was more so unilaterally related to self preservation. It's an unfortunate circumstance of which I'm sure others here have had to endure as well.

Strongly ingrained feelings of inadequacy coupled with complete psychological dissociation turned my life into one that was not my own. I found myself in my late 20's not knowing who I was, what I enjoyed, or what I wanted to do with my life. I've watched a steady stream of my peers effortlessly pass me by, establishing family units, careers, and solidifying who they are as individuals, while I stagnated and continued to withdraw from society.

The first 25+ years of my existence has been purely that, an existence. I've served time in the military, held numerous jobs, and experienced life altering events all without any sense individualism, self worth. It's been a life I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

Fast forward to December, 9 2020

On 12/9/2020 I was perusing Reddit, researching different strategies people implement in regards to micro-dosing psilocybin for depression and anxiety. I randomly stumbled across a post on the trending page about a particular Cryptocurrency and how it was working to give financial identities to those throughout the African continent. This peaked my interest. I began researching different projects and found myself in a world I never knew existed.

Crypto introduced me to a world of permissionless inclusion, a community that doesn't care about socio-economic background or geographical location. A world where lives can be completely changed, all because someone put in the time and effort. For the first time in my adult life I was truly inspired to ignore my circumstance and change the course of my life. Since then, I've intensely started self-studying programming languages, computer science, and smart contract creation, with the end goal of making the world a bit more tolerable for those struggling.

I may still be a bit down on my initial Cryptocurrency investments, but the sense of identity and motivation I've gained on this journey have been completely worth it. I just wanted to make this post as a way of giving back to the community that has helped me find identity and self worth, and to let others know that there is hope.

One small post has the power to change the course of someones life for the better, and I'm truly thankful to the crypto community for being the catalyst I needed to find myself.
