As a developer, I was initially sold on Cardano due to its research-backed approach and emphasis on doing things the “right way”. I began learning Haskell and Plutus in preparation for the Alonzo HF. I bought 10s of thousands of ADA and started a Stake Pool. This slow-but-sure approach helped me justify the poor development documentation, the unrealised hype (birds), and the general unpolished nature of the Cardano ecosystem. This was before I came across Algorand.

Having used Algorand for a few weeks now I can confidently say that this is everything I’d hoped Cardano would be and more. Transactions happen in seconds, not minutes. I don’t need to stake to a pool to earn rewards, and I’m guaranteed rewards; no more Slot Leader Lotteries that favour wealthy stake pools. The development documentation is second-to-none, and it’s easy to find relevant information. 

I have since moved all my holdings to Algorand.

Having some perspective now, I can see why people become evangelical about Cardano. There is a cult of personality around Charles, who is clearly a visionary but comes off a bit disingenuous sometimes. He builds hype and teases announcements that often don’t eventuate, breaking trust and leaving people wondering what to believe. The project has a lot of promise, and I believe it has the potential to do a lot of good in developing parts of the world, but as it currently stands I think it is over-hyped and over-valued."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1912125|public|self|From Cardano to Algorand|0|[]|0.64|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m5w5qe/from_cardano_to_algorand/|all_ads|6|1615834116.0|||||||||1615854059.0||||||||||2021-03-16 00:18:36+00:00|t3_m5w5qe|0|4||

I am a certified public accountant (**not** an artist) that is based out of New Jersey, and I'm continuing my extensive guide covering the interactions of United States tax law and cryptocurrency. You can see links to previous parts on the bottom of the post.

Note: gifts are one of the more complex areas of tax law, and treatment can vary significantly. The below is a **general** overview.

## What is considered a gift?

A gift is any transfer of money or property where full consideration is not received in return.

You purchasing coffee for a friend is a gift, just like receiving a present on Christmas is.

This broad definition means that almost every single taxpayer interacts with gift tax laws multiple times a year.

## Who has to pay gift tax?

Gift taxes are almost always paid by the donor, the recipient doesn't have to think about the tax consequences unless they end up **selling their gift**.

## When are gifts 'taxable'?

Any gift is a a taxable gift, unless it falls under any of the following exclusion:

1. Gifts that are less than or equal to the annual exclusion for the year.
2. Gifts that cover tuition or medical expenses.
3. Gifts to your spouse.
4. Gifts to a political organization.

Gifts to charities are also excluded from gift tax laws, and the value of the gift is deductible.

## What is the annual exclusion?

The annual exclusion is an amount that changes as times goes on. For tax years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, that amount is $15,000.

This exclusion means that a donor may gift up to $15,000 per person before they have to file [Form 709](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f709.pdf).

This annual exclusion is why the gift tax is rarely relevant for most tax payers. Unless you gift $15,000 of money or property to one person in a year, you will never have to file the gift tax form.

## I gifted more than the annual exclusion to one person. Now what?

If you end up gifting money or property worth more than $15,000, you'll have to file Form 709 where you describe the details of the gift.

The amount over the $15,000 annual exclusion is then applied to your lifetime limit, which is $11,580,000 in 2020.

This lifetime exclusion means that even people that do have to file a gift tax form are generally not required to pay any tax on the gift.

## Does the donee have any filing requirements?

Generally: no. A donee does not have to do anything for receiving a gift.

However, when a donee receives property, they should know the original cost basis of the asset, and the date that it was purchased if it's something they may eventually sell or exchange, like cryptocurrency.

## What is the donee's adjusted basis? What about the holding period?

The adjusted basis changes depending on whether your have a gain or loss.

* If you will have a gain: your basis is equal to the donor's basis (generally the purchase price)
* If you will have a loss: your basis is the lesser of:
   * the donor's basis
   * the fair market value when received

This treatment maximizes your gain, and minimizes your loss.

If you aren't able to substantiate the donor's basis, then your basis will be 0.

The holding period of the property will include the time it was held by the donor.

## What happens when a donee sells a gift?

Let's pretend a husband and wife purchase a car for $20,000. The model becomes sought after by collectors of vintage sports cars. They decide to move, and give the to car to the child, when the fair market value is $100,000.

The husband and wife would file Form 709, as the fair market value of the gift is greater than $15,000. They would apply the difference, $85,000, to their lifetime exclusion.

The child decides to sell the car five years later, for $125,000. The child would record a long-term capital gain of $105,000.

## Are there any special rules about cryptocurrency?

As far as I can tell, cryptocurrency doesn't have any specific rules related to gift taxes.

The main concern when it comes to the gift tax is a need for proper documentation. If you plan to gift cryptocurrency, you should make sure the recipient knows your basis and purchase date. This is especially true as it is more than likely the case that they will convert it into another crypto or fiat currency, creating a taxable event.

## A couple of random things

This is just some random information about gift taxes that may or may not be relevant to you:

* The US tax laws for international gift giving are the same. You can send and receive gifts to and from foreign people following the same rules as if they were a United States citizen. Although, foreign people generally do not have filing requirements in the United States. If you receive a gift from a foreign person, you may have to file Form 3520 (&gt; $100,000).
* Having property inherited is far better than having property gifted. When property is inherited through an estate, the adjusted basis for the recipient becomes the fair market value at the time the property is received. This provides you with a tax free 'step-up' which could save the recipient **a lot** of money on taxes if they do decide to sell.

## In Conclusion

Hopefully you were able to get a grasp of how gift tax rules work in the United States. Ultimately, only the very wealthy manage to 'suffer' the consequences of the gift tax law. The main concern, as it always is with cryptocurrency, is to retain proper documentation to ensure you know the value of what you're gifting, and what you're receiving.

I have a little leftover BTC in Binance from when I was doing tests with crypto years ago, it's very little (0.00016974 BTC / 9.50 USD).

I just want to send all of it to Bittrex in order to consolidate my coins. However, when trying to do so, [I have these options and fees](https://i.imgur.com/a1kobUd.png).

The fees for BTC or ETH are automatically over the amount I have, so it is not applicable, and BEP2/BEP20 give me warning asking to double check the receiving end supports it.

Could you please let me know if it is safe to use BEP2 or BEP20 to send from Binance to Bittrex? Otherwise, should I just consider it a loss and move on?

Thanks,

I'm a young professional who has just recently started investing in Crypto.

I am sorry to say that Crypto has not saved my life, get me off drugs, or anything of that nature; I am just merely interested in diversifying my portfolio.

I tried to play around with day-trading shit coins and real coins, but that is just not a worthwhile strategy, so from here on out I'm officially a HODLer.

Most of my crypto investments going forward will be going into ETH, but I have a soft-spot for BAT. Of all the altcoins I've looked at, I have really enjoyed the BAT and the Brave Browser; I truly believe it is a fantastic idea.

I just want to know what everyone else thought of BAT? Is it worth its current price point, more? Does BAT/Brave have long term sustainability? Or is a shitcoin in disguise?

Thanks for your thoughtful comments!

Long story short, I just realised I have some Nanos holding from the 2017-18 debacle and I just remembered.

They were in the original RaiWallet that come to be called Nano wallet and I found them and are safe and sound after all these years.

However, I'd love to trade with them and actually get a bigger sum of em. In which exchange would you recommend me trade with them? Can't seem to be able to deposit either on kucoin or Binance... Maybe I'm just a noob but can't seem to do it...

Hope you're all sound and keeping well. I am new to CRYPTO Currency and today for some reasons I was noting down what are the lessons I have learned so far while getting into this fabulous world and rather than keeping those notes to myself, I thought why not list them down here and maybe you guys could add, sharpen some points or recommend things for newbies like me to work on and improved.

I like to call them the Principles of Trading:

* Trade what you can afford to lose. I've read about so many people losing their mind when they were actually trying to add some profit to x amount. Even if this case you have to be careful as the market is not predictable. Anything can happen. Always trade what you can afford to lose so that you can make better decision in critical time and cut your losses if you hit rock bottom.
* When a Crypto Currency hit a new ATH, wait for it to reach a support then lookout for the dips. I'm not sure about this one and will appreciate the veterans inputs. My lesson is when a coin hits is all new high, those who don't have it, hit FOMO and then buy shares impulsively and later regret it. Take a breath, chill down and wait to see some stabilization/ support and then act.
* Make your OWN RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS - YES, it takes time and maybe you don't know anything but I reassure you that once you learn the curves, you will be the only one who benefit most from this. You are putting your own money at risk, the least you can do is to make sure you know in what you're investing. Of course it's good to ask for advice, thoughts and suggestion but again do your own homework and then act when you made your mind.
* Don't do impulsive buying - I read a nice post today about it's not fun being your own bank and that's so true to me. If you do an impulsive buying without proper analysis and research you might feel bad or worse regret it later. Again think twice before you act and trade what you can afford to lose.
* When you are in a verge of making a big decision you are not sure or don't feel completely sure, I try to sleep it off. The market will always be there and honestly in my humble opinion, if you are trading what you can afford to lose, a share going from 0.6 to 0.3 (just an example) isn't a reason to fail or go against all your invested time. Have some faith in what you initially believe and sometime ""times"" heals everything. Rather than making a rush/panic decision that you might regret later, take it deep breath, take a different approach, think it thoroughly and then ACT. Sleep sometimes can be the best advisor.
* Be selective on what you read and chose to adopt. The internet is full of articles, blogs, forums, books, videos and other medium contents to advise you. That doesn't mean that all of them are right. Welcome ideas and suggestion but again before you act, MAKE YOUR OWN RESEARCH. Even if you aren't so sure about it; go in because you believe in such and such points. If you're wrong, learn from it and don't repeat the same mistake. Moreover, if you're wrong, you just lost what you could afford to lose right ? 
* Treat this as a learning experience and exciting journey to potentially achieve your goals (For some a Lambo, being debt free, a trip to some exotic place or like me; Financial Freedom). If you have a dream, you gonna work for it and earn it in my belief. I believe whatever you think, you can achieve but it won't fall down on you randomly. It will require some efforts, time, perseverance and determination. Also, my personal opinion when you lose; don't take it as failure. Use it as a learning curve making it a gained experience to improve your next strategy.

Voila, that's all for me. I would love and  will be happy if others could add more or suggest on the above. As I said, I'm no expert but that just 2 cents in this fabulous world I've joined in recently.

P.s: Sorry for the typo errors. Looking forward to hear your feedback.
