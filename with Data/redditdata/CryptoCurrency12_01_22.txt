And that is why my advice as a fellow crypto investor that knows shit about fuck is; DCA, stake and close the fucking charts. And if you HAVE to check the charts, set it to the 5 years chart, and remember, 
“When in doubt, zoom out”

Don’t use this sub for advice, just like you shouldn’t use bitboy for advice. Even though crypto is a money maker, you actually still have the opportunity to fuck it up by buying high and selling low. Oh yeah, and then comes the tax man. Long term &gt; short term.

He didn't see any real use case either. 

This kind of doubt is understandable, to a degree. Blockchain and tokenization are relatively new and so are the business models being employed.

I ask myself whether an innovation makes something *better, faster*, and/or *cheaper* (preferably all three). 

The internet opened up more information to more people. It displayed information faster (no need to go down to a library, or mail a physical letter -- though those are great to get). And it greatly reduced the cost of of access to information. The same goes for laptops, smartphones, and other tech.

So does crypto pass the test?

**Defi** — enables access to financial services and trading (so do traditional brokerages), but also yield generation. Individuals can now act as enders (instead of banks) and earn the interest. Assets can also be transferred much more quickly. And in many, but not all cases, transactions can be very inexpensive. Overall, a positive innovation that depends on blockchains.

**NFT's** — as a digital contract and record of ownership they enable far greater opportunities to monetize unique digital assets. They're much faster than the alternative of lengthy legal documents, and much cheaper than lawyer fees. As artwork, well, that's an entirely different story. 

For music, digital ""land"", gaming assets, some art, fractional real estate transactions, NFTS rely on blockchains as an immutable record of ownership. No one would need to file their records at a gov't institution or pay exorbitant fees and wait weeks for a copy of say a deed or marriage certificate in the future.

**Tokenization** — here too crypto and blockchain technology has enable more diversified ownership and revenue models through mining, staking, sharing in information processing that was traditionally a centralized activity. Tokens make that possible.

So, *better, faster, cheaper* certainly applies to many blockchains and tokenization. Not everything of course. The tech is agnostic and is certainly abused. 

But to get a handle on which projects may succeed over the long term, the ones that satisfy these conditions are more likely to survive and thrive going forward."|False|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4314914|public|new|self|Better, Faster, Cheaper — a business fundamental, and the foundation for crypto success|0|[]|0.8|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s28ptp/better_faster_cheaper_a_business_fundamental_and/|all_ads|6|1641980978.0||||||||||||2022-01-12 15:19:38+00:00|t3_s28ptp|0|9||

God forbid, probate, God even further forbid, they held crypto. I started thinking about this more and more since my uncle passed away last year, suddenly, due to an accident. Talked to him that morning, that night he was gone. He left investment properties, stocks, crypto, businesses, etc behind and his wife didn't know where to even begin. We got everything out and into her custody except for the crypto... there's 30 ETH that will probably never be seen again.

Once my own portfolio started to see some pretty substantial balances, I started to show my wife more and more about my crypto holdings (married for 20 years, 2 kids... her family has more money than I'll ever make in crypto so I wasn't as worried about her pressuring me to sell or do something stupid). As much as I tried to get her to understand how the technology works or how to move funds around, she would just glaze over at my words. At the end of the day, I want to make sure that if something were to happen to me that she could access the funds to pay for the kid's college and use it to pay off anything outstanding (been fortunate enough to pay off the house and all the cars thanks to Crypto).

All this said, it made me realize that I needed to find someone I could trust. A crypto Godfather much like how my own kids have a Godfather. Not that I want this person holding my private keys or my physical ledgers and trezors, but someone that could help my wife or kids navigate how to move things off cold storage and sell (but also leaving some dust) for fiat. I've made a lot of IRL friends with some folks that do a lot of crypto investing and we've all agreed to do the same for each other. If something were to happen, our wife or family would bring them our hardware wallets and the person or ""team"" would help them move the money out of cold storage to liquidate.

We have a friend that is a whale that took it to another level. There's 4 lawyers that all have part of his seed phrase and upon his death, the seed phrases are to be joined together and the assets put into a trust. Sounds almost like an infinity gauntlet kind of thing but that's what he's comfortable with. I know another guy that has his seed phrase split between 3 different safety deposit boxes. Each box contains 2/3's of the phrases so any two boxes could recover the seed phrase. Realize though, if you gave most of our spouses, parents or anyone else a seed phrase, they'd have no idea what to do next.

I'm hoping one day we get to some kind of smart contract controlled dead man switch that would make this easier but I wanted to share what some of my friends and I are doing in case something were to happen to us.

I won't give any specific examples, because this really applies to all of them that I've seen yet, but if you go to the sub front page you'll see many posts linking to several of them, it doesn't even matter if you sort by new, hot, or something else, you will see them.

**Why are they all so bad?** People on here love to complain about mainstream media and complain endlessly if they make a tiny mistake when reporting about crypto - or even if they report everything correctly but highlight a negative aspect that people don't want to acknowledge. But with crypto media? They usually read like they are written by a 12-year-old, they make absurdly many mistakes, they report on fake news and surveys that an average cat could easily tell is fake - honestly, often I need less than a minute and one google search to find that a story reported on there is false. They report on horoscopes and astrology, pretending it's some kind of science. Most of them even look really cheap and have an awful layout - shouldn't crypto-people be somewhat internet-savy?

I understand that crypto is still a somewhat recent thing, and that specialized media are, on average, not that great for many topics. But usually it's not THIS bad, it still baffles me - there is SO MUCH money in crypto. Wouldn't it be worth it for a big media company to hire some experienced journalists specialized on finances, some experts on blockchain and crypto, put some money into the project and found a serious crypto news site that fact checks correctly, has people that can write like adults and just does good journalism? I cannot imagine that there is no market for that, right?

In China, it is only a matter of time until the government makes its citizen have to spend 20% on food/30% on rent/ 30% on saving accounts/20% on electricity, internet etc. 

I'm obviously over simplifying BUT you know that their spending will end up tied to their social credit score. Fiat may be bad for many reasons but the ability to exchange bank notes without having the eyes of your government watching you is an important freedom. 

If we end up in this situation globally, one of the biggest tool we have to fight back is Monero. Monero is now the fail safe against centralized powers going crazy through CBDCs. The privacy coin may enable people to resist these kind of horrendous societal changes.

Dogecoin seems to have more real shops accepting it than other currencies. 

Obviously this is a very biased opinion/thought as I am not on every subreddit, just eth/ada/algo/doge/lrc , but I swear every other post on r/dogecoin is just ""I am a small business and I now accept dogecoin"" or ""I just bought pizza from this local shop using dogecoin"" . I never see anything like that from Monero/Bitcoin/Algorand etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this, am I missing something or does dogecoin actually have an advantage in this particular niche because it has a community that's bonkers about it?

Also on a slightly related note, does anyone know any good international or UK websites/business/shops that take crypto as payment except pornhub, tesla and voucher buying sites?

The course will be offered for the first time during USI’s winter school from February 14 to 18, 2022. 

Peter Gruber, senior lecturer at USI, developed the course. He explains: “Writing Smart Contracts is a one-week, hands-on winter school about blockchain and Smart Contracts. It is aimed at students of economics and finance as well as practitioners. No prior blockchain experience is required for this comprehensive learning opportunity.”

The course introduces students to the relevant theoretical concepts and provides a hands-on introduction to writing smart contracts on a modern blockchain using the Python programming language. The goal is to equip students with the necessary skills and theoretical background for creating simple smart contracts and for deploying them on the Algorand blockchain.

“The Algorand Foundation University Programme is excited to support the development of this innovative curriculum for Bachelor’s and Master’s students,” emphasizes Hugo Krawczyk, Principal Researcher at Algorand Foundation and Head of the ACE programme. “We need educational programmes for the next generation of blockchain natives to provide them with the tools to develop applications and use cases.”

The Algorand Foundation is proud to support this project with funding through the Algorand Foundation Grant program. For more information about the Winter School and where you can register,  please visit https://www.usi.ch/wsc. Registrations are open until January 28th, 2022.  

If you are interested in submitting a project for support from the Algorand Foundation Grant program, please apply here.

however, I've been wondering for a while what this is all about. All that strikes me about these chart analysts-Youtuber,

is that they recognize every day any things, of which basically 98% simply never occurs. Doesn't that make them feel laughable?

It really gets on my nerves, every day preach some charlatans that something is about to explode,

because you could read it clearly, but at the end of the day nothing happens. And although this is the case with at least 89%, they celebrate themselves as if they were crypto-Jesus himself. If I spout bullshit for 365 days and a few times the right thing happens, why do I appoint myself a top analyst?

Always ask me if anyone really looks at this bullshit. Zero substance, I can listen to anything from anyone! Please, you guys are by far the least fun at crypto! Why doesn't anyone measure them against their predictions from the week before? Please, someone explain me, from what this raison d'être results? Is there really someone who predicts jumps with high odds? If so, who is it? I would like to be convinced that my statement has no substance. Explain it to me as if I were 5!

I didn't know this when I was new here last year, but you can click on a person's profile and see their posts, comments, karma, what communities they are active in, when they last commented, how old their account is, etc.

Posts and comments on Reddit influence some people's decisions about crypto investments.  We all know to do our own research and that not everyone on Reddit is trying to help others out of the goodness of their hearts, but still, sometimes certain posts or comments have some of us thinking, ""hmmmm, should I invest in that?""  

If you click on the person's little robot/alien guy, you can check out their profile. Obvious things to watch out for are new profiles, people who are basically spamming multiple subs about the same coin, profiles that were dormant for 6 months and all of a sudden the user is active in the past week and bullish on a new shitcoin, etc.  

It didn't take me too long to figure this out last year, but I thought this might be helpful to some new folks  here.  I came across a comment today that I thought was suspicious and clicked the profile and saw it was the first comment from the person in 7 months and that got me wondering how many new members of our community might not yet know to check out profiles, thus this post."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4314887|public||self|"People New to Reddit: When considering the ""advice"" of someone on Reddit check out their profile first!"|5|[]|0.83|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s28l0m/people_new_to_reddit_when_considering_the_advice/|all_ads|6|1641980626.0||||||||||||2022-01-12 15:13:46+00:00|t3_s28l0m|0|83||

For most of us, there aren't gonna be any forms sent out to us for our crypto. We typically don't get tax forms from exchanges, with the exception for special circumstances. So we don't have to wait for any W-whatever tax forms.

# How do I get my transaction information?

The information is already on the exchanges. So it's a matter of downloading the CSV of all transactions.

The part that sucks is we have to compile our own tax forms from and do our own calculations.

# What do I do once I have my transactions from my exchange?

The good thing is we got crypto tax software available out there, that does just that. Calculate our transactions into FIFO or LIFO gains. It takes your CSV files from your exchange, and translates those transactions into coherent information you can take to Turbotax or H&amp;R block.

It becomes a matter of uploading that into your tax filing software, and all the tax forms are done for you.

# Is it worth paying for a crypto tax software?

If you haven't had a lot of transactions, they sometimes offer it for free. Otherwise, it will start at around $30.

But it's definitely worth it.

It will save you a lot of time and headache of doing capital gains calculation. You'll find out quickly that most transactions aren't exactly straight-forward. If you do it on your own, you'll have to figure out which portion of Bitcoin you sold from 1 year ago was for how much, and it might be split from multiple transactions. So each portion has different original costs.

It could also save you on errors and audits. Which could end up costing more than the price of the software.

Here are some well established crypto tax software/apps:

bitcoin.tax, zenledger.io, cointracker.io, tokentax, Koinly, cryptotrader.tax

# Where do I get information and answers about crypto taxes in the US?

There's plenty of information out there. You can also ask any tax CPA. You don't need a ""crypto"" CPA.

The official source would be the IRS.

They actually have a FAQ section answering all the common tax questions about crypto:

Ways to generate: Staking, LM, mining, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be curious to see what your setup is the generate a nice monthly income. Common practices could be (here just Staking as an example):

1) stake ETH / ETH2.0: small yield (5%) yet likely stable, but high security. Low / No access to ETH2.0 as of now, high price stability (low likelihood of price going down vs. other ALTS) high fees to withdraw

2)  stake ATOM (Cosmos): medium yield (14% onchain, 7% CEX), stable Chain with high security (what we know as of now), easy access to coins, low fees

3) stake OSMOSIS (Cosmos): high yield (90% onchain, but probably on short term), stable Chain with high security (what we know as of now), easy access to coins, low fees, high price uncertainty as new coin

4) stake DEFICHAIN (DFI). Medium yields (30-40%), will go down likely, new blockchain but transparent  project team, currently staking mainly only possible through a central platform (on-chain ca. 60.000USD min), low fees, easy access

I had this happen to me today and I wanted to give you all a word of warning. 
Today, I tried to contact Coinbase to help resolve an app issue and make a couple of suggestions. Looking over their website they had links to their social media. 
Facebook, insta, and twitter. 
I wanted to reach out and social seemed the only option they provided. 
Their Facebook has 0 posts from people who follow them (weird)
So I thought I would use twitter. 
So, sent a short tweet (I really never use twitter, not my thing) asking for help with their app and hoped for a reply. 
Well, I got  a reply almost right away from “stranger235789” stating they had the same exact problem and said Coinbase fixed it. 
They provided a link to submit my question. The link pointed to a Google Doc with Coinbase logo and jargon asking for name, email, and 
GET THIS, MY SEEDPHRASE!! 
Are you kidding me? Do people really fall for this? It pisses me off as someone new might not even know to never share your seedphrase. 
1 minute later I got another “offer” to “help”. After looking at the accounts, they also do the same google doc scam on Kucoin! 

I know we’re all smart enough to see this scam for what it is but remember to protect your account and never trust a soul when it comes to money.

Take the first step with ALGO…Moving to Hardware Wallet? Take your first step with ALGO…

I’ve seen many people have issues with delegating their Algorand for this round of governance. A main correlation between these people seems to be holding their ALGO on exchange or in some third party wallet.

It’s scary to move off exchange but ALGO is a great way to start practicing. The native wallet is incredibly user friendly and often offers higher APY. Furthermore, ALGO is fast and practically fee-less….so no nerve-wracking wait (I used to shit my pantaloons when moving BTC).   

#Setting up 

https://algorandwallet.com/

Download the Algorand native wallet , create an “account” and write down your seed phrase (store securely and safely). 

Copy and paste your new address into your exchange app. 

Send a small dummy (practice) transaction to check the address is correct. 

Make that no fuckery, wizardry or voodoo has occurred and then send the full amount! 

#Compounding

Rewards accrue every 9 minutes.

#Compounding APY rewards

While all rewards are available in your balance. A transaction must be made to compound them. 

This can be done through a dummy transaction. 

#To use the dummy transaction

Press Send in the app

Press Accounts and select your own wallet

Enter the amount 0

Preview and send.

The rewards will be added to your Algo balance and APY will be calculated on the new figure.

#Algo faucet

https://www.algorandfaucet.com/

You can use this instead to compound your rewards. 

#Notes
Dummy transactions may not be beneficial in high frequency if you hold a smaller amount of ALGO. 

Fees per dummy are 0.001

Calculate rewards here:
https://algoexplorer.io/rewards-calculator

Any transaction you make can be found here:
https://algoexplorer.io/

#Ledger Nano X

The cool thing is…If you ever get a Ledger Nano X you can easily “rekey” an existing native wallet. 

Meaning, that the wallet will remain an interface to interact with your funds…but….the ledger will be used to verify transactions.

This can be simply done with an open native wallet that exceeds the minimum 0.001 balance, Bluetooth and the Algorand app installed on your ledger. (You select the rekey option in the native wallet while having your ledger open on the Algorand app) 

#There is a downside to this…

The wallet is still restored with the seed phrase provided by the native wallet as it’s a BIP39 seed that uses 25 words instead of ledgers 24. 

However, if you lose/break your ledger you will need to buy another and restore your account to be able to certify transactions from the native wallet. **Thus you will have to remember two seed phrases.**

Anyway, hope this was somewhat helpful."|False|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4311305|public||self|Moving off exchange? Take the first step with ALGO…Moving to Hardware Wallet?

Then I was bored the one day somewhere in 2021 and ended up watching wolf of wall street 2013. Suddenly all the things they were saying started standing out to me, how most people end up losing because they invest with emotions and are easy to manipulate.

 Market insiders and their inner circle dumping as soon as the price is high enough on IPO's and so on.

The manipulation tactics they use over the phone on that movie coupled with how suggestible people become when they seek out ' wealth ' or the ability to become wealthy.

Here is the daily trading volume of NFTs on Ethereum on Opensea only from mid-October to today: 

&amp;#x200B;

[credit rchen8\/Dune Analytics](https://preview.redd.it/wcelu0j5r5b81.png?width=919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e32bbcd885b215d01d8dd727686391a39bf283e0)

&amp;#x200B;

However, what is the reason behind it? 

I'll tell you my thoughts:

The reason is that some NFTs are becoming more and more associated with an "" elevated"" social and financial status.

Think about it. 

On social networks, we tend to show the things we spend money on, pictures where we look great, and how perfect our life is.

So why shouldn't my **profile picture** represent my social/financial status?

It's no coincidence that one of the most popular projects in the NFT world, the **Bored Ape Yacht Club**, has been pointing in that very direction. 

They understand before everyone else that onboarding VIPs get hype, fomo and money. 

*"" If I own a Bored Ape ( BAYC ) or a Mutant Ape ( MAYC ) I'm part of an exclusive community with many VIPs, I have access to private events and parties and I'm rich. ""* 

Anthony, 20 years old*.* 

In my opinion, this is the phenomenon that is currently fueling up the NFT world and will continue to for some time.

&amp;#x200B;

However, you're probably here to know what will be the future of NFTs.

In my opinion, the next big thing will be **equity NFTs** ( eNFTs ) or similar. 

&amp;#x200B;

An eNFT allows you to have **a stake in the treasury pool** of a project and, in my opinion, will be the **2.0 version of corporate stocks**.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take an example.

A Startup wants to raise money to scale up its business and decides to do an equity NFT crowdfunding campaign. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Mints 1000 eNFTs and sells part of them for $1000. 
2. Creates a treasury pool where all future profits generated will be collected.
3. Each eNFT is equivalent to 0.1% of the treasury pool.
4. eNFT holder will then be entitled to 0.1% of the profits generated and this payment can even be daily. 
5. eNFTs, like normal NFTs, can be transferred and resold.  

&amp;#x200B;

Think about having the eNFT of a startup that sooner or later generate profits of 1M per month. 

This consideration of mine is not exaggerated because if we take the example of[Thetan Arena](https://thetanarena.com/), which generated [$80M in less than 3 weeks since its launch](https://medium.com/@ThetanArena/thc-burning-and-converting-program-1-2eedc5d75f16), we understand that the APY can be even higher. 

eNFTs could lead to astronomical levels of APY if you choose the right project and are patient. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was just one example, but I hope I caught your curiosity.

Certik is a junk grade audit firm that audits everything they can lay their hands on with a very basic checklist. They dont really identify if a project is susceptible to hacks. Hell, Certik audited projects have even rugpulled in the past (Eg: MOORE). Certik has audited dubious projects and anything claiming to have passed a Certik audit is not a good look. 

At the other end of the spectrum, audit firms like Trail of Bits and Dapp.org have a renowned history of auditing top tier projects. These audit firms are so busy that its almost impossible to get them to audit a shitty project even if they chuck a bunch of money at them. Even top projects wait for months to get audited by Dapp.org. 

[Dapp.org](https://Dapp.org)'s Uniswap V2 audit report still sets the standard in the space for a quality code audit: [https://dapp.org.uk/reports/uniswapv2.html](https://dapp.org.uk/reports/uniswapv2.html)

Trail of Bits is another reckoned audit firm that has not only audited top projects but also disclosed vulnerabilities in cryptography signature schemes. [https://blog.trailofbits.com/2021/12/21/disclosing-shamirs-secret-sharing-vulnerabilities-and-announcing-zkdocs/](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2021/12/21/disclosing-shamirs-secret-sharing-vulnerabilities-and-announcing-zkdocs/) 

Back to shitty audit firms, just like to CertiK, Peckshield is another audit firm that has had its projects hacked. Eg: Cover protocol. 

The below is a tier list of some audit firms that you can use to rate various projects:

Tier 1 (The best):  Dapp.org, Trail of Bits

Tier 2: Chain Security, Runtime Verification and ABDK

Tier 3: Kudelski, Open Zeppelin, ConsenSys, Quantstamp

Tier F: (Terrible): CertiK, Peckshield 

Its not an extensive list, but make sure you do research on the audit firm before relying on any such statement that shitcoin XYZ was audited by DAB. There are even more terrible audit reports coming in these days"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4314201|public||self|Lets discuss audits: A Certik audit is worthless.

The one I keep seeing is staking TIME on wonderland. I've gone through reddit with some saying it's legit.

Has anyone actually made money on this? My first impression was a ponzi scheme and/or a pyramid scheme with tik tok / youtubers cashing in on pumping up the crypto and dumping before the bubble bursts.

How is this sustainable and what would prevent early investors from selling off and new investors from hanging on.

I got lucky selling close to the top and made some decent profits before things really pulled back.

Over the past couple of weeks I've been DCA'ing into a wider range of projects to give myself wider exposure, but now I feel like I'm spreading myself a little too much.

Current holdings: BTC, ETH, ADA, Matic, LRC, CRO, MANA, SAND, GALA, ENJ, ALGO, DOT, AVAX, SOL, COSMOS, ONE, HBAR, and LUNA.

I only have a couple $100 in each and usually DCA about $150 a week.

I have started exploring on the polygon network and found out about AAVE. I have deposited some MATIC tokens on AAVE to earn interest, but I only seem to be recieving interest in wMATIC tokens, which I have to claim manually.

I couldn't find an answer to this anywhere so I hope I can get an answer here;

Say I deposited funds, wether thats stable coins or MATIC, on the polygon chain into AAVE, I can see im earning WMATIC tokens as a reward, but shouldn't I get rewarded with another token/coin? I'm asking since it shows two different rewards ratio, and the second clearly states rewards in WMATIC, which I'm able to claim in the dashboard.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also added MATIC, wMATIC and AAVE to my wallet but it seems I have not gotten any rewards in there. I've read something about a\_tokens but can not seem to find any info regarding that on the AAVE website itself. I can not even find any information on how to claim interesting on the AAVE website either.

I feel this post highlights the importance of understanding, at the very least, the basics of crypto if you're invested. 

My friend joined some discord for an NFT and was messaged by an ""admin"" who asked for his seed phrase to confirm his wallet.

This dumbass straight up gave his entire seed phrase and he lost his $200 portfolio. 

It goes without saying, make sure you understand the basics of crypto. What is a seed phrase? What is it used for? Why should it be kept private?

There's so many scammers in this space and you gotta be careful. 

Now my friend only lost $200. There's people investing with thousands who don't know the basics, so plssss make sure you research and have a basic understanding of security and what you're doing.

If they increase the intrest rates it's going to crash everyones 401k. So they will be making sure not to increase it too high. So you can be rest assured that the market won't go down any further.  
They would have to do quantitative easing again when that happens, and you all know what that means. More money printing.

Right now they are at a ballance and the current world economy is just pushing inflation even further.

(blockfish.io), a company based in Palo Alto, CA - (650) 796-9381. Of this company, there are only references to the current CEO, a gambling lover Bin Duan, a professional poker player who has worn the T-shirt with the Company logo on several poker play occasions.

Currently, the team hasn't paid any of its suppliers, neither private investors nor hired influencers.

The project suffered a hack on December 17th. Rumors say it was conducted by the team themselves to drain more funds for the project. The developed platform itself has a lot of bugs which caused many investors to lose funds. The team’s inability is evident, and many private investors are suing the team for fraud using the Federal Trade Commission’s online model ([https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/)).

The inability is added to the constant change in the terms for issuing tokens in violation of the initial conditions and of the whitepaper itself, a document that was later hidden and no longer accessible on their web page, which is linked below for convenience. As it happens, in the latest version of the whitepaper, the team also added a final paragraph on the possibility of suffering hacker attacks, in order to cover themselves from any fraud reports.

The team is constantly busy in the community increasing the buying pressure to shed their tokens and continue to flesh out poor investors hoping to make up for their losses. Nonetheless, many are selling, nullifying all the earnings initially anticipated.

What about private investors? They have not yet received any tokens although they were initially promised to unlock them after 3 days from the TGE, then after the listing on a valid Exchange such as Gate.io, and now they promise to unlock if the community votes positively. But how will a community that suffers a large financial loss be able to vote for unlocking?

In short, an unreliable team that does not keep its promises is a team on which it is not possible to bet for a long-term investment.

1. Is it the desirability?
2. Is it the actual art value?
3. Is it just a bubble that will burst and fade away?

I know these questions have been asked a million times in a myriad ways, but for once I thought it was best to ask the experts and enthusiasts on their stance on this. 

1. If it’s the **desirability** that’s making NFTs such a profitable endeavor, then it is all based on the deficit of the rarity of NFTs themselves or the rarity of production from a certain creator. 

a. This doesn’t really apply because some creators make thousands and thousands of pieces that sell and resell perpetually. 

b. Desirability is only based on a delicate balance of basic economy standards; the **Demand-Supply mechanism**. Unfortunately this also means that if the case so happens that creators flood the market with supply ▲ the demand will drop immensely ▼ as *they are at this point inversely proportional.*   

**N.B. If it is only desirability that is pushing the value up of certain NFTs, then why don’t some creators make a desirable element within a singular NFT and let that pump the value of said edition?** **Or make it so that these small elements can be bought or resold separately?**   
   
 *Matter of fact, I read this is what the Royal Falcons Club is trying to achieve; their NFT carry within each edition a collectible ‘rarity’ that provides the current buyer certain rewards (like cash money or even Teslas lol), and these one-off rarities can even be bought and resold separately?*  
 *I’m trying to think of different examples but only RFC comes to mind at the time.*

2. If it is the **art value** that is pushing up the price of NFTs, then how does this explain the case for unappealing assets? Sorry but not all NFTs are good-looking. I know some pieces are very valuable, but that proves nothing, some of them look like sh%t let’s be honest here come on. Some NFT creators are insanely skilled but that is not the uniform case for the whole marketplace.

a. If it is the art characteristics that is making NFTs valuable, why doesn’t the market push more talented creators? I realize talent and art is extremely relative, me being a designer myself, but to me the value of any art piece depends on some factors:

i. The amount of **effort put in.** Some creators work harder than others. Some spend hours meticulously and painstakingly etching out miniscule details within a well thought-out module, and others splash paint on a canvas and call it a day. I know the world isn’t fair and effort isn’t the determining factor, but it is a factor that should be taken within consideration. 

ii. Public perception. Public view and taste undulates and changes with time. Some artists play it safe and go for a universal and timeless style, and others add in their own brushstrokes and history of the current times within their pieces. This too is an important quality. How the public sees a piece as good/bad changes its quality, especially at the time of study

iii. How I feel about it. Not all factors are scientific, and neither is art. I feel that art is a message from the artist to the world, and how I feel about a certain piece is how well this message is translated. 

3. Are NFTs just a bubble? The question every NFT enthusiast hates to answer, unfortunately it must be asked. It is as the stoics say; *the hardest questions must be asked first...(sic)*

a. I don’t think (personally) that NFTs are just a bubble/scam that will blow or fade away. They have gone up and down in popularity but not so much so as to raise alarum bells and panic sirens. I feel that’s pretty safe for now. 

b. I think, despite the fact that NFTs are being used as a cash cow for some, they will eventually evolve into something deeper and of higher value. Like copyright protection for artists, or bills and private ownership claims, or personal possession statements

The world we are living in is fast and confusing. I think every now and then one must stop and ask themselves what’s happening and where we are going."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4313740|public||self|What makes NFTs desirable or valuable?|0|[]|0.95|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s23iod/what_makes_nfts_desirable_or_valuable/|all_ads|6|1641964836.0||||||261fc174-1507-11e4-8375-12313d224df5||||||2022-01-12 10:50:36+00:00|t3_s23iod|0|38||

I've been slowly stepping into crypto since November (lol terrible time to enter the market), but I'm just DCAing into a few coins as I do my research. Just learned about staking - seems like a great proposition. 

My question is: I'm thinking of staking 100% of my MATIC holdings - I have no intention of selling it for a couple years if that - so is this problematic? I am just going to DCA and stake. Is this sensible? Is the main risk (other than just the usual volatility) that it is harder to trade it or something? It seems like a no-brainer the more I learn about it.

Although search volumes of this verbatim query really are decreasing, research by Dr. Jane Vauchfor of the State University of Aberdeen shows that this image is incorrect. 

Vauchfor explains: “When taking into account all spelling variants of the word ‘Ethereum’ interest in the #1 smart contract platform is actually surging by a whooping 1307%. 

Vauchfor goes on to say that especially the alternative form ‘Etherium’ is on the rise. “No one seems to know anymore how the platform is actually called these days.

Most youtubers come down just to thumbnails:

\- When they make their :O face, because they're shocked that they found out something extraodinary 

\- x10, x100, x1000 numbers - scattered steam around them 

\- sometimes we have rockets, moons, ladders to the sky, etc.  

But this youtuber is completely different!

His predictions are sincere and modest, roughly giving you the limit with which the price will move.  

He explains the technology behind the projects, their potential and reduces everything to the level of five-year-olds.  

I was lucky enough to find one coin following him that has gone x10 since then by watching his clips.

Also, one day I decided to try to follow his other advices and I have been making a profit ever since!

I'm not asking you to watch him, I'm just asking you to give him a chance and you certainly won't regret it. Definitely one of the best crypto channels that will grow a lot in the future.

I could see a use for NFTs as a „backup“ for property, cars for example.

But my real issue is, I have 0 idea how to obtain one and sell it later, if I google about it i don’t know what’s scam and what’s real. Is it correct you can only get NFTs in ethereum wallets?
If you receive NFTs in wallets does that work like normal cryptocurrency’s?

Are there any projects that are working on a replacement to a margin loan with cryptocurrency? For example a borrower who can use traditional stocks as collateral for a loan in crypto which is funded by other depositers of crypto (not a bank).  

I understand you can use crypto as collateral now for a crypto loan.   

If there are no projects like this - would this be something thats possible with a smart contract? Or is it difficult to do given stocks are not held on a blockchain?
