I lost 150 ETH on a pretty convincing scam involving a group of people that apparently are from different parts of the world. Here is are what I have on them. At least 3 people are part of the scam:

&amp;#x200B;

\* The one that is supposed to be **the leader**, using the name of **Laurence Purcell**

\- He said he is from UK

\- He used this phone number for whatsapp: **+31 6 87934394**

\- He used this email: [purcell.laurence@gmail.com](mailto:purcell.laurence@gmail.com)

&amp;#x200B;

\* The guy that approached me on Reddit

\- He said his name is **Dean**

\- He used the reddit account **Montana02115** already gone some hours ago

\- He is probably from Netherlands, also there may be another guy named William from Netherlands

\- I have our messages screenshoted, if that matters

&amp;#x200B;

\* The guy that was the coolest and that controlled wallets

\- He said his name is **Moshe**

\- He is probably from Israel

\- He used this phone number : **+972 53-885-3650**

\- He have kids, they were screaming sometimes when he opened his mic (sorry kids, your dad is a scammer)

\- I have the whatsapp history with him, but probably useless too

&amp;#x200B;

**= How they convinced me =**

I talked with Dean ( Montana02115 ) here on Reddit, he had a pretty old account, lots of old posts about crypto everywhere. He wasn't posting for a year, but if you are rich as the character he represented, this makes sense. We talked a little bit here, I said I was trading, he said he was only investing on ICOs/IEOs for some time. He said he was part of a investment group and that the group leader closes deals to buy tokens on private sales before they reach the initial offerings. He said the group needed people that could be really good on finding new projects, hidden gems, that they can approach and close a deal before it gets too known. He offered to introduce me to the guy if I can help on that regard. So, why not? I can do that.

&amp;#x200B;

They use the TeamSpeak software for the group calls. This was their server address = **134.255.231.99:9074**

&amp;#x200B;

They had people there almost 24/7. From time to time Laurence appears and updates the group about the deals. He even gave trading calls, like to short BNB this saturday. There was people on there, you could enter and unmute the sound at some moment and you would hear people talking about the topics they were supposed to be talking about. They were not really just acting to convince me, maybe there was more victims online at the same time as me, which makes it look even more real. TeamSpeak doesn't seem to record those calls or message history, so I can't help with that.

Moshe was the cool guy, at least for me he came and said he would help me. They were buying Perlin last saturday, I wasn't online, Dean came on Reddit and told me Moshe talked with everyone and convinced them to allocate some for me. He ""paid"" 50 ETH for me, he showed me this wallet:

[https://etherscan.io/address/0x17e54a4bb578ef1f8037df331632f27f23f4f6bd](https://etherscan.io/address/0x17e54a4bb578ef1f8037df331632f27f23f4f6bd)

There was 800 ETH on there, he moved exactly how he said he was going to move. He said he didn't care about those 50 ETH, that he was already rich. He wanted to help me because they need more people on researching projects. Next day I received my fake Perlins in my wallet, this is my wallet (fake perlins still there):

[https://etherscan.io/address/0xbb71e39c57420382027ccd087820dfe79204e584](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbb71e39c57420382027ccd087820dfe79204e584)

He also have the same token in his wallet, in perfect proportion. And yeah, I sent him the 50 ETH, actually I sent him 51 ETH. He moved 800 ETH to this wallet, obviously his own:

[https://etherscan.io/address/0xf4be50bebebff2a37bd182d39e271909c2ff6852](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf4be50bebebff2a37bd182d39e271909c2ff6852)

He said Laurence creates an individual wallet to every investor and every investment, after it he divides the tokens using those amounts. If there's a way to blacklist those wallets, we should do it.

The group talked about Perlin, Sovrin, Algorand, Starkware and they were considering Keep Network. Everything continued normal after this first deal, I got even closer to Moshe, we talked a lot. This week there was a round for Sovrin, Moshe again helped me put 100 ETH on it. Laurence sent me a PDF to my email with the contract agreement regarding Sovrin. Moshe controled a wallet with 2000 ETH at that time, he also moved it in front of me, this one:

[https://etherscan.io/address/0x9293d0307e50bae1a3abd12513a410b075c07253](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9293d0307e50bae1a3abd12513a410b075c07253)

I sent him 50 ETH from my wallet and another 50 from my Binance wallet. After that, I said I would wait to sell Perlin. I was always aware it could be a scam, but... believe me, everything was very convincing, even their accents were convincing. I wasn't investigating the fake Perlins on my wallet, and we were going to receive Sovrin only in a few days. I was focused in researching more on Keep Network, as I said it would be doing. Also talking a lot with Moshe.

When Dean and Moshe insisted too much for me to invest in another round of Algorand (it was already on Binance, they said I could sell immediately), I said to Moshe that he should take it as a compliment, but that he was too good to be real, and that he should be honest with me if it was a scam. He blocked me immediately. I was not offensive and that was not his personality, that was when I realized it was really a scam. I got banned from the server, Dean even deleted his Reddit account today. Also, I researched the perlins on my wallet, and they are fake.

Reading now, knowing the end, is like watching a movie in which you are aware of the plot twist. Trust me, they are very convincing liars, the only doubt I had about everything was that it was too good to be real. But good things do happen, I not changing my mind on that, but yeah, shit happens too.

&amp;#x200B;

**= What can you do? =**

\* Post a link to this everywhere, let people know, they can still be doing it.

\* Are you in a position to investigate the information on them? Maybe the phone numbers or the email? Please, do it.

\* Do you know someone at exchanges or a way to blacklist their wallets? Please do it. My ETH is already gone, but maybe there's a way to difficult for them to sell it.

\* Do you know someone that work for news websites or things like that? Send them this.

\* Do you know any other way to report them? Help me do it.

\* Are you a victim too? Don't let this destroy anything good on you. We now work harder and learn from our mistakes. Good things do happen!

\* And finally if you are part of that group and are reading this: you are pretty good liars, really good. But hey, that's what you are good at, you are not the rich successful investors you pretended to be. You never will, you will always be liars. Moshe, put that ETH into educating your kids to be what you will never be: good and honest people! I wish them the best.

# ICON to become fully decentralized and gets STAKING

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone,

In the last days, we saw some price action with ICX and had some nice gains. But this post is not about the price of ICX - tbh it was really flatlined and some used this period of stagnation for accumulating more; some jumped out because of total frustration. However, let's put the price talk aside.

More interesting is, what is happening with ICON, ICONLOOP and ICX. What is brewing and what we can expect from this project? -- in my humble opinion, ICON is definitely one of the few altcoin projects which didn't stop pushing everything in the right direction. The opposite was the case, they hired more and more people, have a solid financial base, completed more and more DApps and worked on their connections with the korean government, which is totally important in terms of building out Seoul as a smart city.  With ""Broof""- a certification system on the blockchain - they set another good milestone for that.

In the moment ICON is about to get fully decentralized and on the 26th of August we all will witness the Pre-Voting and will be able to stake ICX.  **ICON will give away 3 Million ICX** for all who take part in the Pre-Voting event. Everybody who pre-voted and staked ICX during this period, will get a share of this huge amount of ICX! 

Investors will be able to vote and stake via the ICONEX wallet, which will be updated in approx. 3 days; exactly when the Pre-Voting period starts. This will be doable in an easy and safe way via a Ledger!

Personally, I am happy to see progress here, because I still own some ICX and definitely want to stake. What do you think about the upcoming events of ICON?

&amp;#x200B;

Have a great day!"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|918485|public|https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wcZqVzezfmqzhCEKCdG1qrQd1JkaBfBD5t8J2Am9nj4.jpg|ICON to become fully decentralized and gets STAKING|0|1566736157|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/cust7w/icon_to_become_fully_decentralized_and_gets/|all_ads|6|1566629984.0|||||78.0|140.0||{'ff8tsrvb2ei31': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'ff8tsrvb2ei31', 'm': 'image/jpg', 's': {'u': 'https://i.redd.it/ff8tsrvb2ei31.jpg', 'x': 1654, 'y': 922}, 'status': 'valid'}}|||||2019-08-24 12:29:44+00:00|t3_cust7w|0|55|0.75||

    The Volentix Digital Assets Ecosystem (www.volentix.io) is pleased to announce its native digital currency VTX will be listed on the prominent exchange STEX on Friday, August 16, 2019. This will be the initial listing of VTX on an exchange. Volentix chose STEX for its excellent reputation, 99.999% service availability, rapid and efficient support, user-friendly interface, low transaction fees, time-proven financial stability, and base of more than 300,000 users.

Volentix delivers a comprehensive array of utilitarian digital applications, including its downloadable peer-to-peer multi-currency digital wallet VERTO, cross-blockchain decentralized exchange VDEX, market data analysis engine VESPUCCI, and incentives-based recruitment platform VENUE.

&gt;VTX is a utility currency issued on the EOS blockchain. Volentix’s decentralized exchange VDEX offers community members the opportunity to become “nodes” in order to earn VTX by verifying transactions on VDEX. VDEX node participation unlocks compensation from a pool of 800 million VTX.

VTX also permits Volentix community members to access and use certain advanced digital application features and to stake and vote on proposals to earn compensation from a public treasury of 455 million VTX allocated from a total supply of 2.1 billion VTX. Qualifying proposals focus on continuing development and evolution of the decentralized autonomous governance structure of the Volentix Digital Assets Ecosystem. The Volentix community currently includes about 25,000 combined followers on Telegram and Twitter.

WTH do I do with this? I'm told I need to ""claim"" it, which I guess means putting it in a wallet or bank it with an exchange, but I really don't know. And I'm not interested in going deep into crypto, if I'll be honest. I'm happy to take my 27¢ and run.

Summary: Monolith provides 'smart contract wallets' on Ethereum, that provide security features like 'daily spend limits'. They also provide the TokenCard, that allows you to spend ERC20 tokens as fiat through a debit card that's accepted at all traditional debit card terminals.

They raised $17 million in a token sale in 2017, which subsequently appreciated significantly due to the bull market.

They hedged the gains by converting some of that ETH into the DAI stablecoin, so when the bubble crashed, they still had $25 million in assets

[https://rollercoin.com/?r=jnd3afvt](https://rollercoin.com/?r=jnd3afvt)

&amp;#x200B;

RollerCoin is an online, 

virtual bitcoin mining game where you compete against your friends to earn real bitcoins. 

It takes the concept of bitcoin mining, 

but instead of the sophisticated Blockchain and processing algorithms, 

RollerCoin lets you test your skills, 

complete missions, undertake tasks, and play games to earn real bitcoins.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, 

we have cut out the hard stuff and kept the amusement. 

Build and develop your own mining data center, 

make upgrades and tweaks to boost your mining power and compete with friends. 

No real-world set-up, no hassle - just sign up, log in, 

customize your character, and you’re ready to go. 

You’re in complete control! All play and no work - that’s our motto.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

The Rollercoin team talking. 

We are implementing a new token called RollerToken into the game 

which will be the primary currency of RollerCoin! 

If this made you start looking for a link to the white paper, 

there is none as it is not an ICO. 

We are starting this crowdsale event to give early investors a unique chance to 

acquire some of the tokens with bonus and added benefits. 

Everything will be described here, on this exact page.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

The roadmap may change but the approximate timeframe for operations has been planned:

&amp;#x200B;

2019, October

Crowdsale campaign ends

&amp;#x200B;

2019, November - December

Adding new team members, hiring freelancers, developing the statement of work

&amp;#x200B;

2019, December - 2020, February

5 new mini-games, complex system of

rewards, new game items,

multi-mining algorithm

&amp;#x200B;

2020, February – April

In-game marketplace, 

fully-functioning market economy with the real crypto and blackjack, 

beta-version of the mobile app

&amp;#x200B;

2020, April – June

10 new mini-games, 

launching the marketplace for mini-games, 

exchange listings preparation

&amp;#x200B;

2020, June – August

Game scaling, 

the decentralized marketplace for trading in-game items and power, 

the ability to expand the in-game space to infinity

&amp;#x200B;

Assigned support

You’ve been unhappy about delayed response time 

as we are mostly into product development and not messaging. 

We will be happy to get someone for that on board.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do you need a token?

Purchase new and used equipment.

In-Game marketplace – 

you will have a chance to trade and exchange your items and other assets. 

Again, all operations will be conducted in RollerTokens.

Buy upgrades, bonuses, game zones and items,
