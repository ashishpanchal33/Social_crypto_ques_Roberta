Spoiler Alert: kinda (not?), depends on your investment strategy. I do this because i love reallife examples and i hope this helps you guys considering if you want to invest in supercharge events or switch to staking or other earning options.

Also I don't get paid to do this post (my dm's are open though @ CRO) \*wink\*.

I did a few Numbers on a past event just to visualize this for you:

If you participated in the ""DOGE Supercharger Event"" back in February and put 7.000 CRO into the supercharger event (about 900$ back then) and kept it the whole 30 days in the ""supercharge"" event period. When it ends you get a calculated ""reward score"". The Doge reward was 250.000$ worth of DOGE which was 5.000.000 DOGE on March 29th (enddate of event).

This **reward score** is calculated with the ""**Event's Rewards Pool**"" this is basically the whole pot of CRO which was put into the supercharger event from users at peak so it doesn't mean the whole pool is allocated the whole 30 days.

In this event, the Pool was 584.000.000 CRO (!!) so my 7.000 CRO was basically **0,0012 %** of the whole pool but we have to keep in mind that the rewards score is calculated every day for the period , in this case 30 days. We don't know the exact reward score everyday + we don't know if the pool adds up every day until the period ends or if it's an average allocated CRO pool of every day. So you gotta work with the numbers you get when it's finished. With 7.000 CRO allocated for 30 days u would have gotten 0.00000557 reward score.

Quick maths: 584.000.000 (Pool) \* 0,00000557 (reward score) = \~ 3 200 \* 0,0087 (estimated APY for the event was 0,87%) is about 25 and THAT is your DOGE Reward at the end of the period.

In conclusion: you put 900 $ worth of CRO in a 30 days freeze which u can basically unfreeze at any time and got 1,25$ worth of DOGE. That is an APY of 1,6%.

The list of cons and pros can variate if you are a hodler, daytrader or just have a different opinion on this topic. So feel free to let me know your pro and con list in the comments! I'd love to chat with you guys about this topic.

My personal pros and cons list to the supercharger option:

Cons:

* lower APY because of CRO whales
* withdraw your allocated coin at any time, that can cause panic withdrawings which is both pro and con
* no exact APY beforehand (like staking or ""crypto earn"")
* more luck based, you never know how many people supercharge their cro, so APY is extremely volatile and can be different from event to event, even if you put in the same amount

Pros:

* withdraw your allocated coin at any time, same as above
* short period of event time
* earn different kind of coins with one coin allocated
* if you have more, you get more (could also fit in cons, but for me it's more pro because it's a good alternative to crypto earn with a stable APY)

I hope i could help some of you guys to understand the supercharge option better.

I still just own some stocks of companies that I like and use their products often. But I kinda know that in 5-10 years I can see a 10-50% price increase(if they go up at all), nothing exciting like crypto.

With the latest news coming from India about not banning but regulating cryptos, one point today in cabinet was to shift the assets of users from International exchange and allow them to trade on Indian exchanges.   


Now, I have a question. I use Binance for my tradings. Indian exchange named WazirX is owned by Binance and many Indians like me use it to transfer coins from WazirX to Binance. Due to massive price difference, I earned a profit of 14% on GXS by simply purchasing on WazirX and selling it on Binance (market price) 😂  


As WazirX is not that great, hangs during a pump or a dip, many Indians use Binance. But due to upcoming regulations, we will be only allowed to use Indian exchanges. Like Binance has US version, does that mean that people of Binance US trade with people present in US only or do they trade with people worldwide. And If I place a huge sell or buy order on WazirX, will the people buying on Binance can also fill it or only other Indians can fill it. I know this is a strange question but as I have only used Binance in life, I'm having this confusion."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4040349|public|self|Doubts regarding Crypto exchanges|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r78iyw/doubts_regarding_crypto_exchanges/|all_ads|6|1638435129.0|e9570888-9c2a-11e3-809c-12313d1661cc|||||||||||||2021-12-02 14:22:09+00:00|t3_r78iyw|0|5||

The sale utilizes the crowd favorite Bid-to-Earn Auction format, which allows participants to earn GHST (Aavegotchi’s native token) for being outbid. Up for auction are 7,000 parcels within the Gotchi Citaadel portion of the Gotchiverse REALM.

**Dates**

The second land sale begins on Thursday, December 2nd at 10am EST and ends on Sunday, December 5th at 10am EST.

**What’s up for auction?**

Up for auction during the first land sale are 7,000 parcels within the Gotchi Citaadel portion of the Gotchiverse. The Citaadel is the home base for Aavegotchi’s within the Gotchiverse. 

**Sale Format**

The sale will follow the GBM Bid-to-Earn Auction format which allows participants to earn back between 1% and 10% of their original bid each time they are outbid by another user. Unlike other NFT drops that follow the first come first serve model and standard auctions with only one winner, Aavegotchi’s auctions offer something for everyone. 

With the GBM Auction format, we at Aavegotchi like to say you either win or you win. By this we mean you either win the NFT you are bidding on, or you win some additional GHST Tokens by being outbid. Our past auctions that utilized this format have seen participants earn hundreds, and in some cases thousands of GHST just by placing losing bids!

**Do I need an Aavegotchi NFT to participate and what are the benefits of participating?**

No, you absolutely DO NOT need an Aavegotchi to participate in the land auction, in fact there are a number of benefits to participating without owning an Aavegotchi. Obviously the previously mentioned bid-to-earn style auction offers the chance to earn some extra GHST, but there are some other great reasons to get involved and get yourself some land.

For starters, the Gotchiverse introduces 4 new ERC-20 Tokens known as Gotchus Alchemica to the Aavegotchi ecosystem. Gotchus Alchemica are the four elements of the Gotchiverse known as FOMO, KEK, ALPHA, and FUD. These tokens can ONLY be minted by land owners. As a landowner, you will have the ability to rent out your parcels to other players and split the farmed tokens. 

The tokens can then be used to craft exclusive NFTs known as installations. Installations include Clash of Clans style equipment and defenses, social installations such as radio antennas for your own metaverse radio station, and creative installations such as limited edition NFTs in collaboration with artists and brands. 

Beyond that, land parcels are ERC-721 NFTs. You will be able to sell them on any NFT marketplace including the Aavegotchi Baazaar. Guilds, or people looking to expand their real estate in the Gotchiverse, may want to merge with your parcel as well, depending on its location. Just like in the real world, some land parcels will be more desirable than others.

**What makes this land sale different?**

Aavegotchi’s second land sale stands out from most metaverse land sales in a number of ways. Unlike most metaverse land sales, each land parcel’s location has in-game ramifications. Parcels next to Alchemica deposits will see bonus servings of Alchemica that can be farmed from their parcel. On the other hand, parcels that are not adjacent to Alchemica deposits will still enjoy base ranges of Alchemica, but will not receive any boosts.

The auction also uses a random number generator known as Chainlink VRF. When you purchase a parcel, you can estimate the total Alchemica based on parcel size and whether or not the parcel is near any Alchemica boosts, but you won’t know the exact amounts until the game goes live and Chainlink VRF is engaged. You can think of the total Alchemica amounts as four dice rolls, one for each type of Alchemica. 

**What exactly is the Gotchiverse?**

The Gotchiverse is a space where players will be able to explore, build, battle, earn, and socialize. Gotchiverse gameplay will be a mix between Clash of Clans (building and upgrading installations on your parcel) and an exotic version of Pacman (running around the map to find additional loose pickups of Alchemica). 

The Aavegotchi team has been working tirelessly to make sure the Gotchiverse gameplay is as immersive and rewarding as possible. To help do this, we recently brought on Senior Engineer Game Advisor named David Fried to help balance the gameplay. David previously spent over a decade at Blizzard Entertainment working on games such as World of Warcraft, Diablo II, and Warcraft 3. To put all of this another way, the Gotchiverse is going to be unlike any other play-to-earn game in existence.

**When will the Gotchiverse go live?**

The Citaadel portion of the Gotchiverse will go live in January, while the full Gotchiverse will be live later in Q1 of 2022. 

**How do I participate?**

To participate in the auction all you need is a Web3 wallet like MetaMask, [gotchiverse.io](https://gotchiverse.io) in your browser, and some GHST Tokens on Polygon Network!"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4035169|public|self|Everything you need to know about Aavegotchi's 2nd Land Sale|0|[]|0.5|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r6nvxm/everything_you_need_to_know_about_aavegotchis_2nd/|all_ads|6|1638369624.0||||||||||||||2021-12-01 20:10:24+00:00|t3_r6nvxm|0|0||

If I want to maintain a 10:1 price ratio of ETH to BTC.
So if ETH is $4,000 and BTC is $40,000,
And for simplicity’s sake, if I have $44,000
I would buy 1 ETC for $4,000 and 1 BTC for $40,000.

Well that’s easy math haha…
But what if ETH becomes $5,000 and BTC becomes $45,000. The ratio is now 9:1.
If I say $50,000.
How do I allocate to maintain my desired 10:1?

Does that make sense?
Or maybe this is not the right way to do it?

The reason why I ask is because I don’t want to put 90% into BTC and 10% into ETH every month. What if ETH becomes much cheaper in relation to BTC, so I would like to buy more ETH. But I want to be objective and have a formula thus the 10:1 ratio for now.

Working with The New Republic staff writer Jacob Silverman, McKenzie made waves in early October after penning a Slate piece with his partner titled “Celebrity Crypto Shilling Is a Moral Disaster.” The duo called attention to Kim Kardashian’s Instagram account promoting the token EthereumMax (EMAX) in early June, a project whose price gained 116,000% in just one week before shedding more than 99% of its value, leaving many in the red.

*“Celebrities are lending their names and promotional talents to everything from NFTs to crypto exchanges to their own custom coin offerings,” said Silverman and McKenzie. “Together they are communicating something clear but terribly misleading: that cryptocurrencies, and the many shady areas of this gray-market economy, offer a path to sustainable riches. The truth is almost always the opposite.”* [Source](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/11/23/kim-kardashian-crypto-ben-mckenzie-js-orig.cnn/video/playlists/business-digital-currency/)"|False|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4035249|public|self|'Crypto Critic' — Hollywood insider has a message for celebrities who shill token projects.|0|[]|0.9|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r6o5du/crypto_critic_hollywood_insider_has_a_message_for/|all_ads|6|1638370301.0|87049662-0882-11e5-82e1-0e9d1a9f7761|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'xt3RAxYtMlTPeTvWLIxw-FNvqzfSvu5w2H2XeSpIcFI', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BApG-aXo3QF2-NPGKT5zCIleOMsAMws1oxwQELuhohI.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75664d2fe0775fb4e96b3114ca9adb74433cdbad', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BApG-aXo3QF2-NPGKT5zCIleOMsAMws1oxwQELuhohI.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35d2eb462b5810f931a00f7782824b660e803f29', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BApG-aXo3QF2-NPGKT5zCIleOMsAMws1oxwQELuhohI.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b42cdf236a04f1206d4ba08eebede77670824af6', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BApG-aXo3QF2-NPGKT5zCIleOMsAMws1oxwQELuhohI.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52d750ae07b7d8ba067ea3b497c5e0e1e8366576', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BApG-aXo3QF2-NPGKT5zCIleOMsAMws1oxwQELuhohI.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7db25a62bed7b53c27a30ba785f789d4368da35', 'width': 960}, {'height': 607, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BApG-aXo3QF2-NPGKT5zCIleOMsAMws1oxwQELuhohI.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ced901d0eb4f0f3c28db015ef091aaf6fe278415', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 619, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BApG-aXo3QF2-NPGKT5zCIleOMsAMws1oxwQELuhohI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3916b1ddb792142b7846de05c7b037a3f85bf075', 'width': 1100}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||2021-12-01 20:21:41+00:00|t3_r6o5du|0|8||

After I discovered the Defi world and in particular liquidity mining (A.K.A. Yield Farming) a couple months ago. In these days I started making some NFTs during my free time. I actually thought that it's a complicated process to do, but at the end you just  need to upload your pic/painting/pieceOfArt and put it on auction. For this reason, I thought that this post might help you get the push you need to step in the NFT world. I used algogem.io so I payed no fees to upload the NFT and setup everything.

The idea proposes the reorganization of the Internet in order to remove centralized data hosting services, using instead a peer-to-peer infrastructure. Interest in the decentralized web arose due to the lack of trust in network maintenance organizations, due to scandals involving widespread espionage and content control.

Source: Wikipedia

So now we are seeing different DeFi solutions, dApps and much more popping up. Is idea of decentralized web so far reached nowadays? 

Imagine if we could engage with people on internet without censorship or other limits. That would create lot of wonderful discussion about everything. But there would be illegal content too. 

In example we all have seen propaganda in mainstream media about cryptos, stock markets and many other things. If things would be decentralized people could see other side on subjects like these."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4034680|public|self|The decentralized web is an abstract concept.

It’s extremely important for them to know about things like inflation, investment options, saving/spending, supply/demand, etc. 

It’s also crucial (IMHO) that I teach them about crypto since it will be another investment vehicle they’ll need to understand and consider. 

Anyway, I decided I needed help from colleagues in developing lessons that spanned our curriculum (K-12). But as I was asking my colleagues (“Hey! How much do you know about cryptocurrency? How about blockchain?), not a single one knew anything about it. 

Some had heard the name, or their partners “read about it”, but not a single one had a clue. Shouldn’t we be one of the firsts to be aware of important changes in how the world works, and educate our learners about what to expect in the future?

Long story short, my plans have been side-tracked and I know have to start orange-peeling colleagues before anything else.

Who in their right mind would sell there? Like, come on, just let us enjoy a new all time high!

But on a serious note, the Ethereum chart looks a lot better than the Bitcoin chart. Ethereum is still putting in higher highs, it's bouncing a lot harder and it didn't drop as much as Bitcoin.

I have a feeling that many people have lost interest in Bitcoins returns and are now going into altcoins, for higher returns. 

That doesn't mean Bitcoin won't go higher, I think Bitcoin can go to 200K by the end of next year. But for now most altcoins are looking a lot better. 

Btw, you'll know when it's time to panic when the market drops and the Bitcoin dominance shoots up, that means that the big institutions are getting scared as well. As long as that doesn't happen, they are still comfortable in altcoins.

The artwork and NFTs in game are pretty sweet. This is my first experience in an NFT ""game"" though, so I can't quite compare to other NFT games like Axie Infinity.

I can see the appeal in wanting to have cool shit in this game. Anyone play Habbo Hotel? Or RuneScape? Or most other MMORPGs for that matter. Except instead of having really in-game expensive/rare items, you have ""metaverse"" expensive/rare items, which cost real money. And to be fair, even the examples of Habbo Hotel &amp; RuneScape create enormous real-life wealth for people; albeit being against the rules of those games. 

The weird (but also cool part) is that the metaverse is sort of like a MMORPG but RWT (Real World Trade) is not against the rules. It's entire the point of the game. And it's backed by trustless and immutable authentication blockchain technology.

Shit I'm looking at a random painting in the Alpha Hub Main Hall and when you interact with it in game, you can then view it in the marketplace (also pretty seamless), but latest offer was for $1200?!

So, what do you think? Have you tried it? Do you think there's future potential for this to grow and breed a generation of meta-gamer-investor-art-collectors?

Would it still be valuable?  I think yes.

ETH has been getting absolutely ripped on this sub, but within the past 24 hours it looked to be on the way to a new all time high.  I post negatively about it all the time, including now, but also hold some.  For a while I thought people still buying this are crazy, given how much it costs to use-- but I can't bring myself to sell it, because I think it is going up.  So for me, I have begun to separate it in my mind from the networks I actually use and consider to be in play for the future of blockchain.  I am thinking of it more as a store of value or meme coin.  Something like a mix between capped supply BTC and meme DOGE.  It is ETH, and it is singular.

Clearly some people are using the network, but crypto is still niche and it is choking hard.  People are buying for the same reason they buy BTC or DOGE.  The value is in the name, the dramatic narrative, the rich people clinging tightly to their bags, and the new people who can buy it easily without fear of doing the wrong thing.  There will never be another BTC, ETH, or DOGE even if everything goes to 0.  Their legacies are cemented.

I realize ETH paved the way for smart contract crypto.  It was the first project I ever supported.  Many lessons have come and will come out of the development.  But I think it is unlikely to ever compete with newer protocols.  I think it will appreciate, but become like BTC, which people used to think of more as a currency and way to transact.  People just hoard it now, as there are better alternatives.  If they are not just hoarding it now, they are doing it wrong.

The good news is that these are asset classes nobody has ever seen.  People always bring up the MySpace narrative-- but MySpace didn't have its own network with digital assets held by many rich people.  It was just a web app.  I really think these popular cryptos will be as they say, like digital gold or digital silver or whatever.

They only do it cause they lose money and power not cause they care. Every time they are more against crypto it should be more bullish news for us.

I do not care what politicans do. Banning crypto in some country mean nothing. People will still invest just ""illegally"". More grey area and more hate toward goverment is all they will achieve. More radical  decisions against crypto they will made, more radical reactions they will get. At some point crypto investors will just lobby to took down anticrypto politicians in next elections. There is always someone that want to took politicians positions and they would happily help crypto if tha woulr help them.

Banks can't stop crypto too. Never all of them will stop you possibility to buy crypto or withdraw profits. They are to greedy to hold the line. No bank can ignore billions of profit. And even if they would there always will be other ways to buy and sell crypto. Crypto dealers could be a thing and it would mean just less profits for banks. Average crypto investor hate banks, antagonizimg them more is dumb choice from banks side. They think we will just let them do whatever they want. If my bank woulr block me from buying crypto next day I would find new bank. Just like that.

So I really don't care what politicians or bankers say or do. They can't stop crypto. There will always be other bank or other country that will support us.

However, very few people know that it wasn\'t his only idea. He had a second. He proposed another crypto technology to solve the ""[Bitcoin snack machine](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423.msg3819#msg3819)"" problem. What Satoshi is describing in the link is an idea to settle transactions asynchronously, in under 10 seconds, through node propagation rather than the traditional mining that Bitcoin uses.\n\nSound familiar? It didn\'t occur to me that his second proposal is in use *right now* until I came across the project doing some research. That project is called Nano. While the comment is clearly not fully fleshed out, his approach appears to be an early stage brainwave on the potential for DAGs - Directed Acyclic Graphs, settled through node propagation (more specifically a system for rapid distribution of ""seen first"" transactions through a mesh network of connected nodes, which only Nano uses to my knowledge), no mining, and allowing for settlement in under 10 seconds. In other words, [exactly what Nano offers](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-nano).\n\nWhen I found out about this and looked into Nano and its founder, Colin LeMahieu, my first thought was ""cool, so Colin got the idea from Satoshi"". After more digging, a surprising amount of coincidences started popping up.\n\nWhen reading the respective white papers ([Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), [Nano](https://content.nano.org/whitepaper/Nano_Whitepaper_en.pdf)), I found their writing styles to be rather similar. I\'ve worked in text/language analysis in previous years and have a little experience and a few connections, so I decided to dig further and pull in some help. We used a little magic to do a comparison, starting with the whitepapers (in part with help from LIWC engine). The person providing the following responses and results is a well known expert in this field, however he didn\'t want to be named (has no interest in crypto) so I\'ve removed a few identifying pieces. [I\'ve made available what I can in our emails in a pastebin.](https://pastebin.com/TDxLUpd9)\n\nInitial response.\n\n&gt; tl;dr: I can\'t rule out the possibility that it\'s the same person, but it\'s definitely not a resounding ""yes, same person"" conclusion either. Forum posts might help disambiguate a bit more, especially if there are a good number (e.g., 30 or 40 posts) of a good length (at least 50-100 words apiece, longer is better) for each person. Authorship attribution on shorter/fewer texts is generally an unsolved problem in the field. But, if that type of data exists, more is always better, and throwing in a few people who definitely aren\'t the same person is helpful as well.\n\nFortunately this extra forum data exists since both have forum histories on Bitcointalk. [See next response.](https://pastebin.com/uiRyk3JE)\n\n&gt; I\'ve pulled Colin and Satoshi\'s forum posts and cleaned them up, plus another random 10 users or so just as a baseline comparison. It\'s definitely the case that Satoshi and Colin are quite similar -- much more similar than Satoshi and just some other random forums users. The degree to which they\'re similar, however, varies from ""they\'re the same person"" to ""they\'re similar, but definitely different people"" depending on the analytic method chosen here. This is common, and I\'ll preface this by saying that the more ""simplistic"" analytic methods show them as being highly similar, whereas slightly more sophisticated approaches still differentiate them without any trouble. An example using a statistical method called linear discriminant analysis basically says that they\'re identical (note that the ""ungrouped cases"" here is Colin):\n\n&gt; That said, a couple of caveats here. The first is that, in both graphs, notice that Satoshi\'s cluster is quite tight and well-defined. Colin\'s cluster is more diffuse. One reason for this is that there\'s less language data for Colin, so the estimates of his positions are a bit more uncertain. However, this could be taken as evidence of a couple of other things:\n \n&gt;    * He\'s more variable than Satoshi in general, which might mean that he is a bit less of a ""fixed"" personality than Satoshi.\n&gt;    * The posts being made by Colin are authored by more than one person, one of which could be the user posting as Satoshi\n\nThere certainly appears to be something there. I tried to discover other connections outside of language analysis and didn’t come up empty handed.\n\nIn the latest known communication from Satoshi, dated April 23rd 2011, he mentions [having moved on to other things](https://plan99.net/%7Emike/satoshi-emails/thread5.html). This is followed by his enigmatic post about him [not being Dorian Nakamoto](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A52186) almost a full 3 years later (March 7th 2014), after which nothing was ever heard of Satoshi again. [The first commit to the Nano Github](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/commits/master?after=e2fa840fdbc7ea47f51413b1ec043c5489922dfc+3035) happens *less than 2 months later, on May 1st*.\n\n[While claiming](https://medium.com/nanocurrency/the-nano-faucet-c99e18ae1202) in official communications that Colin developed this new distributed network alone, [the first post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/2p6utv/raiblocks_unique_cryptocurrency/cmtvkk5/) about RaiBlocks (the prior name for Nano) oddly mentions ""we"" (remember the possibility above that Colin’s bitcointalk account--writing of which is oddly similar to Satoshi’s--was used by multiple people).\n\n&gt; RaiBlock makes one small change to existing cryptocurrency algorithms focusing on the two biggest adoption issues: high energy cost of hashing and slow transaction confirmation time. RaiBlocks achieves decentralization without the need for mining and at the same time lowers confirmation time so transactions can be confirmed almost as fast as they’re broadcast to the network.\n\nIn the famous ""[If you don\'t believe me or don\'t get it](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306)"" comment Satoshi is linking to the snack machine post to explain how this could be as fast as swiping a credit card. [In a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/argentina/comments/eom7nu/ama_con_el_creador_de_nano_una_moneda_digital_m%C3%A1s/fee0u7o/) by Colin on Reddit, he mentions how ""our transaction speed makes it useful as a payment method. You can complete a Nano transaction faster than a credit card transaction"".\n\nThe original Bitcoin white paper was created in Mountain Standard Time. The original Nano white paper was created in Central Standard Time. These are time zones that border each other in the United States. We know that Colin has lived and worked in and around these areas at various points in his life.\n\nAt some point we may do further analysis of available texts.

As far as crypto goes this is surely that 'killer app', the gateway drug that will onboard millions, if not billions, of new users.  And everyone wants a piece of the action, driving any (and it seems all) games up to spectacular, and already bloated valuations.  While I cannot claim to be immune to this hype cycle (I FOMO'd into a little indie game I am almost certain I have no intention of playing before I'd even had time to reflect upon all this) I have subsequently been thinking about all this noise, and the other big thematic running the market presently, the metaverse, to try and find an angle.  


So rather than investing in a single game, or even a Gaming Studio, or getting me a big old fat bag of MANA or SAND and buying the top after these have surely pumped, what's your average and reasonably broke investor to do? (its been a long bull run and I don't know about you guys but I'm fast running out of dry powder!)  Throw it all into one project, and hope its the next Axie?

No, no and no.  Seems to me that one should be strategic about this.  And, please remember, dear reader, that none of the following is to be construed as financial advice, please always do your own research before making any investment decisions...  that being said I do have the following thoughts to offer on how I am playing the RTS game called crypto at this point in the market cycle.

While I believe those espousing a 'lengthening' cycle are right, and this bull run still has a way to go before the curtain falls, we hit the matador's spear and collapse into a bloody bear market, this run is getting, like this sentence, a little long in the tooth.  Many influencers on both YouTube and Twitter are looking for signs of a 'blow off' top, or confirmation that we are indeed experiencing the mythological ""Super Cycle"", the run to end all runs.  And while they may be right recent events ***outside*** of crypto have given me cause to pause and evaluate where in the cycle we might be.  Here, I am going to be preaching caution (please send all hate to our customer service team on 1-800- GET HELP) but please do hear me out, I have my reasons.  A quick summary of recent events that have me concerned that a bear market may be hitting us earlier than most expect include: the Chairmen of several Feds selling their holdings on 'ethical' (!!??) grounds, hawkish rhetoric from Uncle Jerome as inflation begins to spiral out of control, massive amounts of insider selling among the mega-corps (Musk and Cook and their subordinates to name but a few), an ongoing global logistical clusterf@#k that shows no sign of letting up, and seismic tremors from China's real estate sector (sending out waves of defaults, and the questions that really have me worried: how much Chinese commercial paper is Tether calling collateral? *AND* what happens when those debt instruments are finally marked to market?).  While it is true that time **IN** the market beats timing the market, with many small projects in crypto already at absurd valuations thoughtlessly FOMOing into the next game that launches promising mass adoption and five hundred new worlds to explore is, IMHO, a fast track to getting turbo-rekt.

With all this in mind my own approach is manifold, but first and foremost is about being patient.  Beyond that I think now is always a good time to become more ***strategic*** about how I invest, and to begin to think about which kinds of projects are likely to survive the next bear market, if it indeed should occur.  So rather than single games or gaming platforms what I am looking for and researching at present are those projects building out the ***infrastructure*** that will be necessary for gaming and the metaverse to become mainstream.... when it comes to that fast track I would rather bet on the rails, than any single train destined to travel along them.

**HYPE CYCLES; 'LAYER 2' SEASON?**

***If*** we are to see another hype cycle this late in the bull run I am of the firm belief this will occur among projects building out solutions to Ethereum's diabolical and hugely expensive scaling issues.  Alternative Layer Ones have done very well this run, and I think have very little steam left.  But what is of real interest to me are the so called Layer2 projects.  Ethereum, lets face it, is where things are at, as I asserted in my previous post it is only those chains that differentiate themselves from ETH by targeting a different demographic that I believe will have a serious long term future in these markets.  Most layer 1 projects are very much 'me too"" projects and once the hype goes out of the market could face a fate similar to that of ADA (although to their credit most seem to, unlike Cardano, have a working product, so I could be wrong, and Solana in particular is going after gaming hard: Bitspawn is a little project on SOL that has caught my eye).  But layer 2s have me excited and I am actively investing in them.  Rather than mentioning a single coin I will merely mention a few projects I am looking at or holding: Large cap: Polygon Matic; Mid cap: Loopring, Immutable X; Small Cap: Metis. And please, please, please guys, do research the space before apeing in, there are too many projects to list here and my listing or not listing them is no guide of how to best take advantage of this nascent space.  If you have any picks you are looking into or invested in please add them to the comments.

Why are layer 2s destined to grow?  Simply put, no gamer is going to be able to afford over a hundred dollars in fees to buy an NFT that takes the shape of an in game item or skin or what have you.  ***Micro-transactions such as those enabled by layer 2 ('roll up') solutions will be necessary for the entire gaming industry,*** *or at least those games, workshops and platforms that launch on Ethereum****.***

With all that being said other projects I see having massive utility in the payments space are indeed protocols that bridge different chains, in that regard I have my eye on both Rubic and Synapse.

**THE RENDER NETWORK:**

All these games and metaverse projects are going to require an unprecedented amount of GPU power, one that local and even cloud solutions are likely going to struggle to meet.  To that end I think that the Render Network (RNDR) is another key piece of infrastructure for the future of gaming and VR and thus of crypto, and still has plenty of room to grow.  Simply put this project is a network on Ethereum that is creating a vast decentralised pool of GPU power to facilitate ""the process of rendering and streaming intricate virtual works"" (*source: Render Token Whitepaper*) and a marketplace for 3D assets and tools.  I highly recommend having a read of this white paper, IMHO this project has the potential to become huge.  

**FINAL THOUGHTS:**

This is getting over long so I want to bring it to a close. If there are two notions I hope readers take away from this little post its one, do look outside of crypto now and then to the state of the markets and economy in general to better time your entries (there are bound to be more buying opportunities in time so never rush in), and two, think beyond specifics to the big themes that are going to drive the growth of crypto going forward, and look for those projects building the ***infrastructure*** that is going to be necessary to realising this vast potential market.  And a final word to those who have followed me, thanks for your patience, but I will post only when I have something I think is compelling and thought out to say, I am trying for quality over quantity with this little side project of mine.  Any and all feedback is appreciated, as are ups for visibility."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4036629|public|self|Real Time Strategy: Crypto ain't no (single) game|0|[]|0.85|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r6tzlx/real_time_strategy_crypto_aint_no_single_game/|all_ads|6|1638385425.0|c1034ee6-9c2a-11e3-a8c4-12313b0e8e20|||||||||||||2021-12-02 00:33:45+00:00|t3_r6tzlx|0|12||

Just recently I cashed out some profits and my wife asked where the money came from, I tried to explain it to here and I got the typical “oh so it’s drug dealing internet money?” Lmfao

So I pulled up some articles and tried to explain the very basics to her and her response was what I expected, “so you have been putting tea money into fake internet currency? Why? These ppl online aren’t even speaking English from what I can see”

How do I get the basics across to her without to much of the lingo and without coming across as being condescending? Any help would be great as I’m planning to hodle the rest of what I have for 5-10 years and hopefully it will be life changing for us.

Peer-to-Peer trading, commonly known as P2P trading entails a couple of people selling or buying cryptocurrencies directly from each other. It is a type of trading in which vendors and buyers register on a website known as a peer-to-peer platform, marketplace, or exchange. They can eventually post advertisements for cryptocurrencies to be purchased or sold with a specific price range and location.  


[CrowTrades](https://crowtrades.com/) is an excellent choice when it comes to P2P trading as it gives access to a number of withdrawal options, payment methods, and transaction execution times. On [CrowTrades](https://crowtrades.com/), users must verify their email and phone number to access the P2P trading platform. Without the verification, you may not deposit tokens to your account or access the system.  


**Benefits Of P2P Trading On** [**CrowTrades**](https://crowtrades.com/)

**4. Service Of Escrow**  
As one of several safeguards on the platform, the [CrowTrades](https://crowtrades.com/) P2P’s escrow service includes a reserve mechanism for crypto money invested in any pending transaction. This method avoids theft or scams by establishing a second degree of trust, preventing scammers from taking your money or cryptocurrency without completing their side of the transaction.  


**5. Transactions Are Swiftly Completed**  
Merchants can limit the transaction lengths to 15 minutes on P2P platforms. This implies that you may complete a secure and fast P2P transaction with selected merchants in under 15 minutes.  


**Escrow Service**  
[CrowTrades](https://crowtrades.com/) offers crypto escrow in all P2P deals to protect consumers' crypto assets. The quantity of crypto for the ad is immediately withheld from the seller's wallet when the ad is placed. This implies that if the seller takes your money and does not deliver your crypto, or if the seller forgets to release your crypto on time, the customer service team of [CrowTrades](https://crowtrades.com/) can transfer the asset from the seller's wallet's reserved funds to your wallet.  


**Customer Support**  
If you encounter a problem during a P2P trade and are unable to reach an agreement with your counterparty, you can seek assistance from [CrowTrades](https://crowtrades.com/) customer care staff. To investigate and resolve issues, the customer service staff will contact consumers through email.

And when I researched into it, it apparently isn't just a problem people in Germany might face. The EU hasn't allowed for implementation of above mentioned card yet, so Apple Pay will just tell you that ""the selected card is not yet supported in your region"" and that's it. Luckily there is a pretty easy workaround for this, which is called ""Curve"". Curve is a app avaible for iOS and Android, which has the ability to incoporate and manage your virtual debit- and creditcards. Besides that, it also allows you to store your loyalty cards of different stores for easy access.

Setting up the Curve app took me about 10 minutes. You will be asked for your residential information and some form of identification (Passport,driver, etc.)

After you successfully opened your account, you are given the option to connect a card to Curve. Here is where you have to connect your Visa card with your Curve account (It is very easy and straightforward).
After that, you can either go back to the Wallet-App or connect the Visa-Card directly from the Curve App to Apple Pay (again very easy and straightforward).
Congrats, you can now use your virtual Crypto.com Visa card through Apple Pay.
One important note to mention however: Make sure you have the Visa card selected in the Curve app, so it gets used as the primary form of payment.
The standard version of a Curve account is free to set up and use, though they do have tiers to which you can upgrade to.

I’m heavily invested in ETH and BTC and will remain so but I’ve always been skeptical of other coins and their long-term utility and longevity. 

Besides the obvious risks of cryptocurrency such as regulation and potential irrelevancy of certain coins, etc what are the downsides of staking? Tax purposes, potential for piracy or personal data theft, etc. 

I’ve looked into other staking platforms such as Anchor and Algorand, but CRO seems to be the most popular and, in my opinion, has potential for upside in the long-term, so what are your guys’ thoughts and what do you suggest?

This summit will be focusing on the most recent ZK related solutions that Polygon introduced in the past three months (Hermez, Nightfall, and Miden).
