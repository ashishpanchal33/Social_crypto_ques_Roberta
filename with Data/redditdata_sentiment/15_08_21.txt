They try not only to steal money, but also sensitive data. Or they just want to completely destroy a system by running a dangerous script. The blockchain is also aware of this danger: Many attacks have taken place in the past, of which the 51% attack is probably the best known. A fairly new attack is the Dusting Attack.

# What is Dust?

Dust is a term that has been used in the crypto world for much longer before it became known by the Dusting Attack.

In the crypto-space, we call a very small amount of crypto coins or tokens dust. This amount is often so small that you do not even notice that you have it in your wallet.

In essence, you can poses as little of a cryptocurrency or token as possible. For example, in Bitcoin's case, it is possible to have 0.00000001 Bitcoin (BTC) in your possession. The value of this is almost $0. This number of Bitcoin is also the smallest amount of Bitcoin that you can own.

The moment you make a transaction on a crypto (centralized or decentralized) exchange, a small amount of the relevant coin or token may remain. On some exchanges it is possible to exchange this dust for the native token of the relevant exchange. For example, at Binance it is possible to exchange dust for BNB.

In the case of Bitcoin, we speak of dust when the outcome of a transaction is lower than the transaction costs. This is also referred to as the dust limit, which is calculated based on the input and output of a transaction. For typical Bitcoins transaction, which do not use SegWit, this is 546 satoshis. For SegWit transactions, this number is 294 satoshis.

When a transaction is less than the mentioned number of satoshis, you will not be able to complete the transaction, resulting in that dust will remain in your wallet. 

# Dusting Attacks

During a Dusting Attack, hackers try to steal crypto coins by means of dust. Many users do not even notice when there is dust in their wallet. That's why hackers send lots of small amounts of crypto coins and tokens to different addresses. They then monitor all these addresses. For example, they check whether the dust is sent to another wallet, which also belongs to the victim. By keeping track of all these wallets, they know which wallets and addresses belong to the victim.

They then use this information to carry out a phishing attack. For example, they can send you a link with a malicious script running behind it. The moment you click on the link, the attack is carried out, after which the hackers try to steal crypto coins and tokens from your wallet.

# Where Dusting Attacks are performed

Generally, Dusting Attacks are performed on the Bitcoin network. However, attacks on Litecoin (LTC), Binance Coin (BNB) and several other crypto coins and tokens are also known.

# How to recognize a Dusting Attack

It can happen that hackers try to carry out a Dusting Attack on you. For example, there were hackers who tried to carry out a Dusting Attack on the Binance crypto exchange in October 2020.

You can recognize a Dusting Attack by looking at the crypto coins you have received in your wallet. The moment you have received crypto coins from an address that you do not know, there is a good chance that it is a Dusting Attack attempt.

In some cases there is a link in the transaction, which usually is a phishing link. Of course, you should never open such links.

# What to do in case of a Dusting Attack

Do you think there is a Dusting Attack attempt on you? Then you don't have to do anything. Just leave the crypto coins in your wallet and do not send them to another address that belongs to you. The most important rule is that you should never open a link that you do not trust.

# Protect yourself from a Dusting Attack

There are several measures you can take to protect yourself from a Dusting Attack. These measures also help you to protect yourself from other attacks.

As mentioned before, you should never just click on a link. If you don't know where a link will take you, don't click on it. It can always happen that a phishing attack is carried out. After all, there are enough cases from the past where many users have lost large amounts of crypto coins and tokens.

It is also important to install a virus scanner that scans your computer or laptop daily for viruses. If something has gone wrong, the virus scanner can ensure that the virus is cleaned up before it can cause damage. It is also advisable to use a VPN, so that your internet connection is extra protected against external influences.

To really protect yourself, it is recommended to use a hardware wallet, such as Trezor or Ledger because Dusting Attacks are usually carried out on hot wallets.

# Other crypto attacks

The Dusting Attack is of course not the only attack known within the crypto world. There are different types of attacks, some of which are carried out on individuals, while others are carried out on the entire community of the blockchain.

# Ransomware

Ransomware is becoming an increasing problem. Not only individuals, but also large companies have to deal with ransomware. You probably know that ransomware is a type of malware that can take over your entire computer.

The moment you have ransomware on your computer, all your files will be encrypted. That means you can't use them anymore unless you have the special key to decrypt them. And now the coincidence occurs that only the hackers have this key.

They want to give you the key, provided you transfer a certain amount of Bitcoin to them. This can vary between a few hundred to several thousand dollars. If you don't transfer the money for a certain amount of time, all your files will be destroyed for good.

You can protect yourself against ransomware by using a virus scanner and not just opening a link or downloading a file. It often happens that hackers send an email with, for example, an invoice. However, when you open the invoice, ransomware is downloaded. If you are not expecting a certain email, file or link, it is better not to click on it.

# Cryptojacking

To understand this hack, it is important to understand how the mining process works. In cryptojacking, someone's computer is used to mine crypto.

Again, the victim must first download a file from the Internet. Then the file will ensure that the computer power of the victim is used to mine crypto for the hackers. They are also the only ones who will receive the rewards for mining the crypto.

With cryptojacking, you can also protect yourself by using a virus scanner and not just opening a link or downloading a file. You can just download a file without knowing anything about it.

# 51% attack

The previous discussed attacks are usually performed on individual users. However, there are also various attacks that are carried out on the entire blockchain. Of these, the 51% attack is the most well-known.

Within the blockchain network, a consensus is made when at least 51% of the network supports it. Imagine a miner has a block ready. Then the nodes in the network will check whether the block is valid. When at least 51% of the network agrees with the block, it will be added to the network.

This also means that when one person or organization controls at least 51% of the network, the entire blockchain can be controlled by this organization. In this way, transactions can be approved that should not actually be approved at all. In that case, the blockchain is completely corrupt.

With a 51% attack, the goal is not financial gain, but destruction of the blockchain. The moment a 51% attack is performed, the price of the relevant currency immediately collapses. There is therefore virtually no financial gain to be made by the hackers.

Luckily, the chance that such an attack will be successfully carried out on, for example, the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain is virtually nil. This is due to the large network that is behind these blockchains.

# Conclusion

You should now have a better understanding of how frequent performed attacks such as Dusting Attacks, Cryptojacking, Ransomware and 51% attacks work. In order to not get rekt, make sure you:

1. Don't open any links you don't trust.
2. Never share your Private Key.
3. Never share your seed phrase."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3323796|public|self|Frequently Used Crypto Attacks: Dusting Attacks &amp; More|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p4q36k/frequently_used_crypto_attacks_dusting_attacks/|all_ads|6|1628998255.0|SECURITY|e533981c-10d9-11e7-89fd-0e374a7b7cbc|SECURITY|||||||||||2021-08-15 09:00:55+00:00|t3_p4q36k|0|15|0.89||3||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||15_08_21|08_21|0.14445342|0.5298369|0.3257096|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.08460193127393723|0.26939502358436584|0.01669912412762642|0.4251999855041504|0.19285431504249573|0.011249514296650887

I sold off all my previous shitcoins and was looking to get a real crypto portfolio started. I was having trouble deciding on the breakdown of BTC / ETC vs Alts and was curious your thoughts on the following 3 options?

**Option 1 (least aggressive):**

-	60% Bitcoin
-	30% Ethereum
-	4% Solana
-	3% Chainlink
-	3% Aave

**Option 2 (more aggressive):**

-	50% Bitcoin
-	35% Ethereum
-	8% Solana
-	4% Chainlink
-	3% Aave

**Option 3 (most aggressive):**

-	50% Bitcoin
-	25% Ethereum
-	16.5% Solana
-	4.5% Chainlink
-	4% Aave

I know a lot of people like different Altcoins like ADA, etc but for now the above 3 (sol, link, aave) are the ones I have researched enough to feel comfortable with.

Early today I was woke up and looked at my gaming rig I mine with while I sleep ( GTX 1660, i5 9400f, 32 GB ram) and it read the normal $1.70 daily and $52.80 monthly. (a pretty modest amount) I had been looking into over clocking my gpu slightly, and when I decided I wanted to I restarted my pc and shutoff my miner ( I use better hash and mine ETH and XMR) after I finished OC’ing my GPU I started up my miner and checked the hash-rate, which showed to be my normal 18-22. Then when I looked over at my monthly income it showed I will earn a estimated 40 or so dollars a month, and my daily was around $2.90. Now I looked at these numbers and thought “hey that’s weird, but I like those numbers so I’m gonna leave it”. Well I went downstairs for dinner later, and came back upstairs to see my pc frozen. So I restarted it made sure my OC was still applied and opened betterhash to start mining again, well my hash rate is the exact same as before but I’m back down to $52 a month. Did ETH stocks jump or something? I just wanna know because I’m curious and I would like to know more about crypto and mining.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post, have a good day."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3322813|public|self|What happened with my ETH miner?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p4kvrm/what_happened_with_my_eth_miner/|all_ads|6|1628973314.0|MINING-STAKING||MINING-STAKING|||||||||||2021-08-15 02:05:14+00:00|t3_p4kvrm|0|2|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||15_08_21|08_21|0.09943512|0.50272423|0.39784065|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0823168158531189|0.11424129456281662|0.01224549487233162|0.49923110008239746|0.2819773554801941|0.009987949393689632

Unicorns are mythical animals and it is used to represent the statistical rarity of an investment getting to such a position.

Uniswap the popular decentralized finance application is named after Unicorns and uses a Unicorn as its symbol.

In finance, what ***a Unicorn actually refers to is a privately held start-up company valued at over $1 Billion.*** So essentially nothing in crypto is a Unicorn Investment because they are not companies and are not privately held (instead they are widely held). 

**Examples of Unicorns include:**

SpaceX, Stripe, Epic Games, Telegram, Ripple (not XRP), Discord and Reddit.  

If we ignore the company and privately held qualifiers, anything valued over $1 Billion is a Unicorn. Anything over $10 Billion is a Decacorn and anything over $100 Billion is a Hectocorn.

There are now an estimated 700 Unicorns and 30 Decacorns, the number is growing quickly.

Valuations of Unicorns are usually determined by recent funding rounds, as they are not publicly traded and often do not have strong earnings to base a valuation on (growth is the main metric).

**Bonus term: Black Swan Event**

A Black Swan Event is something which was thought to have been impossible or highly improbably, very hard to predict or rare. An example of a Black Swan Event may be Bitcoin dropping to $100 this year.

The term originated in Europe as something that is an impossibility (think ""pigs can't fly""). In the 16th century it was commonly used in London as a statement of impossibility, as all known records and observations of Swans were white.

However in 1967, Black Swans were discovered in Western Australia by Dutch explorers.

Perhaps the most important is the jettisoning of the “miners” who track and validate transactions on the the world’s most-used blockchain network. Miners are the heart of a system known as proof of work. It was pioneered by Bitcoin and adopted by Ethereum, and has come under increasing criticism for its environmental impact: Bitcoin miners now use as much electricity as some small nations. Along with being greener and faster, proponents say the switch, now planned to be phased in by early 2022, will illustrate another difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin: A willingness to change, and to see the network as a product of community as much as code.

1. How are Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions tracked?

Cryptocurrencies wouldn’t work without a new type of technology called blockchain that performs an old-fashioned function: maintaining a ledger of time-ordered transactions. What’s different from pen-and-paper records is that the ledger is shared on computers all around the world and operated not by a central authority, like a government or a bank, but by anyone who wants to take part. Satoshi Nakamoto is the mysterious and still-unknown creator of Bitcoin and its blockchain. What Nakamoto accomplished through the proof of work system was solving the so-called double-spend problem that plagued earlier digital cash projects: Because the blockchain records every single transaction on its network, someone trying to reuse a Bitcoin that has already been spent would be easily caught.

2. What is proof of work?

Proof of work systems existed prior to Nakamoto’s 2008 Bitcoin white paper, but the concept had never been put to such grand use. In Bitcoin and Ethereum today, transactions are grouped into “blocks” that are verified and published to a public “chain” every few minutes. The proof of work necessary to publish the latest block is done by miners whose computers perform millions of trial and error computations to change a given input into a required output. The first miner who succeeds in producing the required output shares it with the network, which checks to see if it works, and is rewarded for the effort with free cryptocurrency. The system also sets a floor of value on the coins -- no one would invest the electricity, computer hardware and other expenses of mining unless coins are worth at least that amount.

3. What are the problems with it?


When Bitcoin was barely known and worth pennies, mining was also cheap. But as its value rose, an arms race of a sort set in, as miners poured in resources in the quest to be the first to validate a block and win new coins. As a result, the system’s electricity usage is now enormous: Researchers at Cambridge University say that the Bitcoin network’s annual electric bill often exceeds that of countries such as Chile and Bangladesh. This has led to calls from environmentally conscious investors, including cryptocurrency booster Elon Musk and others, to shun Bitcoin and Ethereum and any coins that use proof of work. It’s also led to a growing dominance by huge, centralized mining farms that’s antithetical to a system that was designed to be decentralized, since a blockchain could in theory be rewritten by a party that controlled a majority of mining power.

4. What is proof of stake?

The idea behind proof of stake is that the blockchain can be secured more simply if you give a group of people carrot-and-stick incentives to collaborate in checking and crosschecking transactions. It works like this:

* Anyone who puts up, or stakes, 32 Ether can take part. (Ether, the coin used to operate the Ethereum system, reached values of over $4,000 in May.)

* People in that pool are chosen at random to be “validators” of a batch of transactions, a role that requires them to order the transactions and propose the resulting block to the network.

* Validators share that new chunk of blockchain with a group of members of the pool who are chosen to be “attestors.” A minimum of 128 attestors are required for any given block procedure.


* The attestors review the validator’s work and either accept it or reject it. If it’s accepted, both the validators and the attestors are given free Ether.

5. What are the system’s advantages?

It’s thought that switching to proof of stake would cuts Ethereum’s energy use, estimated at 45,000 gigawatt hours by 99.9%. Like any other venture depending on cloud computing, its carbon footprint would then be only be that of its servers. It also is expected to increase the network speed. That’s important for Ethereum, which has ambitions of becoming a platform for a vast range of financial and commercial transactions. Currently, Ethereum handles about 30 transactions per second. With sharding, Vitalik Buterin, the inventor of Ethereum, thinks that could go to 100,000 per second.

6. What are its downsides?

In a proof of stake system, it would be harder than in a proof of work system for a group to gain control of the process, but it would still be possible: The more Ether a person or group stakes, the better the chance of being chosen as a validator or attestor. Economic disincentives have been put in place to dissuade behavior that is bad for the network. A validator that tries to manipulate the process could lose part of the 32 Ether they have staked, for example. Wilson Withiam, a senior research analyst at Messari, a crypto research firm, who specializes in blockchain protocols, said the problem lies at the heart of the challenge of decentralized systems. “This is one of the most important questions going forward,” he said. “How do you help democratize the staking system?”

7. How else is Ethereum changing?

The most recent change was called the London hard fork, which went into effect in early August. The biggest change to the Ethereum blockchain since 2015, the London hard fork included a fee reduction feature called EIP 1559. The fee cut reduces the supply of Ether as part of every transaction, creating the possibility that Ethereum could become deflationary. As of mid-August, 3.2 ether per minute were being destroyed because of EIP 1559, according to tracking website ultrasound.money. That could put upward pressure on the price of Ether going forward. Another change in the works is called sharding, which will divide the Ethereum network into 64 geographic regions. Transactions within a shard would be processed separately, and the results would then be reconciled with a main network linked to all the other shards, making the overall network much faster.

Monetary systems are being slowly eroded by money printing (dilution), most crypto enthusiast know that. **But crypto will cause another silent effect, much more powerful, that will accelerate the devaluation of fiduciary money** by diverting its energy flow.

Crypto will store future value because it’s better in doing so. Any fiduciary money, including dollars, will be powerless against the effects of this realization.

The hypothesis is: **any monetary energy (value) that is being “stored” in fiduciary currencies will gradually be diverted and flow to crypto assets**.

The outcome will be clearly seen in inflation. Inflation can be a symptom of two effects: (1) monetary energy (value) being diluted (amplification of the denominator) and/or (2) value flowing out of a monetary system (reduction of the numerator).

The first effect is well known, but the second effect not as much, it has not fully kicked yet, and it is orders of magnitude more powerful. 

Now, we are experiencing mostly dilution, but sometime the next years the effect of value flowing out of the fiat system will be explosive. **Infinite inflation**.

Once the market clearly realizes that, it’s the end. Every value stored by humanity will start flowing from fiduciary assets to crypto assets. **It’s slowly happening right now, like a sinkhole forming quietly below the monetary systems.**"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3322708|public|self|The silent effect of crypto|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p4k79l/the_silent_effect_of_crypto/|all_ads|6|1628970506.0|SPECULATION|3d5fe240-70f9-11e8-95ba-0e0d9c4aac4a|SPECULATION|||||||||||2021-08-15 01:18:26+00:00|t3_p4k79l|0|21|0.78||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||15_08_21|08_21|0.1058338|0.4481893|0.44597685|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.06887347251176834|0.13158805668354034|0.01260214764624834|0.5141336917877197|0.26247766613960266|0.010325027629733086

There's also post about stopping or limiting the daily discussion karma counts. It disheartening to see so many ppls jumping on the bandwagon without giving any thoughts to it. 

  We're complaining about 3rd world moon farmers are flooding this sub with shitposts without any evidences.  Majority of them can't even afford an education.  Needless to say read or write fluent English. How can they shitpost in prefect English and grammars?  These posters are not 3rd world countries farmers but US or Europeans. 

  Moon is currently around. 30 each. Might not seem like much to most of us in developing countries, but to ppls from 3rd world countries, it enough for a meal for 3. These ppls spend 10 hour a day slaving for big companies in sweatshops making the clothes and other stuff we're buying daily for 50 to 80 usd each. Earning between 2 to 3 usd a day.  How i know this?  I do have friends living in Laos and India. 

  Everybody just take a deep breath and relax.  If we don't want to read shitpost or comments just keep on scrolling pass it. There's also the filter you can use to filter out what you don't want to read. We are a great community with ideas, compassions and knowledges. Show them that we care and  willing to help out the less fortunate ones. These moons they farm could actually change quite a few families. 

Most of them spend their times on the daily discussion anyway.  So, just leave the daily discussion section as it is if you don't want them to spread to other section.  

   All I'm asking from this sub is to be more patience and tolerance for these poor ppls trying to earn extra to help better their life.

The fact that third world countries can benefit in so many ways makes me extremely happy and optimistic. People can earn a small salary which compared to their country's can be pretty significant. Furthermore, corrupted governments as in many other countries, but especially in africa, control everything and for a civilian to earn and spend his money without manipulation is something rare! It gives them a form of freedom which they desperately need and can hopefully lead to many changes.

I’m definitely deficient in this area, driven by my proclivity to hodl and that I’m looking at crypto as a 3-5 year investment (at least). However, I can adhere to my general long term plan, but still make profit along the way and increase my coin holding.

The only time I fully went against my instinct was not selling MATIC at ATH, not a disaster, as I expect it to eclipse it in due time, but I could of sold then and bought the dip to increase my coin volume.

Personally, I think we'll see many Central Banks introduce their own CBDCs in some form, as the benefits to government are numerous.

Despite that, I often wonder... how ""good"" or ""bad"" will CBDCs be for private cryptocurrencies? (and when I say ""private"", I mean traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, as opposed to privacy coins exclusively). 

I'm in the camp that CBDCs would be broadly beneficial to the adoption of cryptocurrencies. My thinking is that should Central Banks introduce CBDCs - a form of digital money - then it would legitimise the idea of digital assets to the general public. Therefore, your Joe Blogs with no particular interest in crypto, may feel more inclined to look into cryptocurrencies:

""...If the government has its own digital money, then maybe Bitcoin really isn't a scam!?""

^^At least, that's the sort of thinking that could be going through Joe Blogs' head!

I see the introduction of CBDCs as a reason to invest in cryptocurrencies for the long-term. However, I would like to hear other views on the topic. 

Do you reckon CBDCs will increase the proliferation of cryptocurrencies among the general public or do you think it won't make any material difference? Or do you take the opposing view entirely and think CBDCs will be bad for adoption?"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3325479|public|self|"CBDCs - Central Bank Digital Currencies - ""Good"" or ""Bad"" for private cryptocurrencies?"|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p4z87n/cbdcs_central_bank_digital_currencies_good_or_bad/|all_ads|6|1629033357.0|FINANCE|709d50a8-1deb-11e4-9b08-12313b0b24aa|FINANCE|||||||||||2021-08-15 18:45:57+00:00|t3_p4z87n|0|4|0.83||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||15_08_21|08_21|0.11076456|0.4499968|0.43923864|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07071885466575623|0.20293867588043213|0.01466779038310051|0.2337827980518341|0.4597536027431488|0.018138350918889046

I’m a block-chain developer working on the ethereum protocol for some years now.

Having inspiration from the power that traditional hedge funds have over the market, the Gamestop short squeeze and how the trading platform screwed up the simple trader to benefit the hedge funds at the end, I thought that would be a good idea to create a fund that will be completely controller from the majority of the people using it. I believe that will give the simple traders a united voice and a power to perform more complex trading strategies like the ones that hedge funds used, or like crypto whales do. The block chain will offer trust, and the community by combining their money will provide power. Some key functionality will be:

* Everything will be decentralized and open source. After set and done the full controlled will be given to the members.
*  For any trading activity a vote will be posted by a member of the fund. Then a vote will be held by the community that has money in the fund and the majority wills decide (with a percentage minimum of something like 65%)
*  Every vote will have power in relation to the money that the member have in the fund
* A cup of 5 million maximum investment per member will be placed to prevent a situation of centralization.

If you will be interested in such a fund kindly vote up.

The user pays to hold their files on storage providers' nodes, and the files are distributed through satellites. The more satellites, the more decentralized the network is.

Looking at storjnet info, we can see that tardigrade has 6 satellites, meaning that there isn't a lot of decentralization in the project as there is nobody else who has any online and public satellites. We can however see that there is a lot of distribution among the nodes, as there is a total of 12,000 nodes online, in at least 90 countries!

The coin is #135 on coinmarketcap and has a market cap of $359 million. Comparing this to one of their competitors Sia, that's a difference of about 260% - making Storj the lower market cap option.

Storj has been partnering with a lot of smaller Ethereum projects lately and is still in constant development, but I couldn't find an up-to-date roadmap to see what they are planning to release next.

If you want to utilize Storj yourself, the easiest is probably signing up on Filebase &amp; creating Storj buckets for your storage :) You could also look into running your nodes, or developing new systems for Storj."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3325780|public|self|"Bringing Light to Low Cap's #7 | Storj"|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p511cv/bringing_light_to_low_caps_7_storj/|all_ads|6|1629039316.0|CLIENT|c1034ee6-9c2a-11e3-a8c4-12313b0e8e20|CLIENT|||||||||||2021-08-15 20:25:16+00:00|t3_p511cv|0|14|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||15_08_21|08_21|0.12868376|0.4246554|0.44666085|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.1379556953907013|0.35149896144866943|0.01769876293838024|0.2853624224662781|0.1942172795534134|0.013266895897686481

We all know Venezuela is known for its hyperinflation and I just found out that Nano faucet Wenano is being deployed in the area especially in Caracas where some people literally has their life depending on it.

In Columbia their bank is going to heavily support crypto and also the country treats crypto as personal property and refuses to tax it.

Argentina also has pretty bad inflation and where the peso fails to act as a currency Bitcoin takes its place within the locals in exchange for goods.

And obviously you may have heard this recently but El Salvador just made BTC legal tender and owning them can get you citizenship.

Am i educated enough on markets and trading to know them? - **no**. Do I understand these metrics do exist and can be super helpful / accurate? - **yes**. 

My question is this - where are people getting the whole ""If \_\_\_\_\_ coin goes to \_\_\_\_\_ then it will end up doing \_\_\_\_\_\_ next""? 

Where on earth are people getting these thresholds from? I ask because as far as i have seen - basically nobody has been right about most of the crypto market. So in a market with so much volatility and uncertainty where are people finding this whole ""If ETH can hit \_\_\_\_ price then they can stay alive and go upwards from there""? It seems like it doesn't matter what BTC, ETH, or any other coin do in a current moment because everything seems so based on public opinion. One day Musk can make a shitty tweet and crash the price and then who cares what BTC was doing the day/week/month before. The price tanked...

A quick look at any BTC fees chart will tell you every single transaction in the mempool can be mined into the next block, leaving the pool empty. That makes the current fee approx. 2 sat/byte.

What is their justification for a $26 withdrawal fee?

When and where can you use them and how do they benefit our everyday life? In this post I will try to answer these questions.

When and where can smart contracts be used?

The short answer is everywhere at anytime for anything and that’s the beauty of it! It can help automate an insurance process, make trading more fluent without the need of middle men and make supply chain management more transparent and resistant to frauds. But what about some examples. 

How do they benefit the every day life?

So we know that smart contracts can do a lot of good but what are some real life examples of smart contracts making everyday life a bit better? Here are a few:

Insurance

The insurance sector effects us all and you will with almost 100% certainty stumble upon some kind of insurance situation in your life. Hopefully it’s because you’re to getting paid money and not the other way around but either way, this sector is filled with disputes. For example, take automobile cases where both drivers blame and demand payment from each other because of an accident. Solving that kind of dispute is often extremely slow and tedious for every party involved. With the help of smart contracts it can become a lot faster. It’s hard to do on its own but if the smart contract is set up with the right policy, documents, and ways to capture data, it can execute itself shortly after the accident. What can take several months today could with the help of a good smart contract be solved within days or even a day.

Trading

As stated above, trading can become more seamless and cost efficient with the help of smart contracts and some companies already use them for this purpose. It’s quite self-explanatory why smart contracts are good in trading. The company can create a smart contract with predetermined conditions that need to be met. When a buyer then comes in to the picture and meet those conditions he gets his product (e.g. shares in the company).

Postage

Even sending a package with a parcel can be better with a smart contract! This following example is taken directly from [this source](https://medium.com/@blockchain101/using-smart-contracts-in-daily-life-b39f44af0b2a) and was very helpful to me when I tried to understand the more everyday use of smart contracts!

“The process [to create a smart contract for sending a parcel] could be as follows:

- Both you and the postman agree on the contract terms and price of delivery. Let’s say its 1 eth.

- The postman gives you his eth address. You create the contract in the Ethereum Blockchain with a hashed password, postman’s eth address and deposit 1 eth in it.

- Postman checks that the contract does indeed has 1 eth staked and goes ahead and deliver the parcel.

- Once the parcel is received on the other end, you will send an sms with the plain password to the postman.

- The postman calls the releaseFunds function in the Smart Contract with the plain password.

- The Smart Contract sends 1 eth to the postman’s eth address.

- Deal done.”

While this is very simple it’s a good example of a very normal life situation where a smart contract could help smoothen the process!

There are more examples out there and if you can think of one or more don’t hesitate to comment. Hope you guys learned something from this!

In this time period I had almost no contacts because I was in university and with my graduation the pandemic began. The connection to most of university got lost, most moved to different cities and began working in an office somewhere.

After graduation, I finally decided to tell my family and 2 close people about my crypto adventure and suddenly everything changed. After some months my family told me that I have changed and have only this crypto thing in my mind. All of my efforts of explaining the reason of crypto to them was like talking to a wall. After weeks of discussion, I moved to another city and have no contact to them anymore.  

Was it a mistake to talk about it in the beginning?  Now i'm living in an apartment in a new city. To not get bored I'm looking for a good place to work here and there, without success so far. Was this financial freedom a blessing or a curse for me? I think of different things what I could spend money on: property, build a small house on it, and then? Most ideas which come to my mind seem like a dead end for me and with this pandemic it's also hard to build up a new social environment. 

Do I just need more time and I'll find a way? I don't really care about the money which I made during this time until today, i'm not greedy and always prefer to live a humble life. It's difficult for me to find people who are in a similar position like me with which I could spend time with. (besides my actual profession at a place where I could work now)

Is there any suggestion one could give to me? Or is there someone with a similar experience who could give an advice for me? I'm not depressed or sad, but days/weeks/months are passing , I research things which are of my interest, ride bike, do sports, yet it feels like something is missing.

And you should be. There are a ton of frauds in my line of work. But some of us are genuine. I’ll make it as short and sweet as possible:

In late 2019, after many years of spiritual practice, I had a mystical experience which allowed me to be accurate with tarot cards. I immediately began reading for others, and now, less than two years and 4,000 readings later, fully support myself as a professional psychic dude. 

The easiest way to explain it, is by comparing a tarot deck to a book of life, only the pages are cards. Shuffling the cards, mixes up the story, and when I lay them out, it’s like looking at a unique picture book of my client’s life. I can see the recent past, the present, and about 6 months ahead. 

I read for people all over the world, and because of this, I realized I am able to see global events. For instance, back in February I started to see people getting out and being more social (the Hermit card, reversed) around May and June. Using logic, this told me that things with covid were going to start getting better around that time. I posted about this publicly on my instagram in February.

Then, in April, I started to see certain clients getting money around July (the Nine of Pentacles, reversed). So much so, that I made note of it on my phone with voice memos, and started asking these clients if they had any investments. Some had stocks, some had real estate, but the one thing they all had in common? Crypto. So in June, I again made a public post, sharing this information.

As July went by, I started to worry. Maybe I was wrong? But sure enough, as you all know, things took a turn for the better around week 3. And here we are, back in the bull run, feeling good.

But what happens next? Aside from some alt coins, the market seems to be pretty much going sideways. If my past predictions serve me, then I don’t think this is the end. 

Recently, I began seeing the pattern again, of certain clients feeling fortunate. The time frame? Between September and October. I know at least one of them has crypto. So, can i say for sure that this is the next big run up? No. But from what happened in July, I certainly believe it could be. And based on a dream months back, I believe Bitcoin could get to at least $95,000, if not higher. Once that occurs, I believe it will mark the end of this bull run, and I’ll be taking profits.

For those of you who are still skeptical, I welcome you to check my IG: sleepwlkrr

I recommend starting at the February post. It’s the picture of me holding my cards. From there, you will see various testimonials and audio recordings, to provide evidence of my accuracy. I’ve also been streaming here on r/pan from time to time. You’re welcome to check those out, and read the feedback from clients in the chat.

And of course, feel free to ask me anything here, and I’ll try to respond. But maybe….just maybe…you should remember this post. 

See you in October :)"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3325615|public|self|I’m a professional psychic who predicted the July pump.

Will leave with my favorite quote from The Office:

What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin.

It’s true. 

In bull I feel like a genius, reading those analysis, checking whitepapers and calculating projections based on mcap, treading defi waters and searching for new low mcap coins. 

The moment bear hits, I instantly go holding momma Bitcoins skirt and not even peeking out at those scary alts. I just hodl silently too scared to move.

I feel like a goddamn Rainman sometimes. 

The moment bull starts: balls out veteran hodler crypto analyst putting dollars in every weird alt possible. 
And everything pumps!

That is until after I deposited a humble £100 and tried to actually use it.

Then I tried Ledger Live (Coinify) again transaction declineds by issuer.

I spoke to crypto.com customer sevice (which tbf was quite quick to respond) and they confirmed I cannot purchase crypto with my card from the crypto exchange...lol.

However, I do not think a bot deserves the highest amount of credit for contributions to this community, and thought that bots were mostly discouraged, if not banned outright? Its not effort any longer, its automated. Sure, power consumption and cost to create and maintain. But we all have power consumption and have paid for the devices and internet connection maintained to utilize this platform as well. Theirs may be higher, but automated earning is a slippery slope. 

Makes me think that there are many more of them throughout this sub, and they are getting karma for being an automated program which maintains internet connection.

 I'm a pretty straightforward investor when it comes to crypto. I've stuck with mostly BTC and ETH for hodling, but I've also put smaller amounts of money into some altcoins with hopes of faster growth.

I managed to buy some TEL when it was at .009 last month. It felt like a risk since the market was struggling, but I also felt like (and still feel like!) it was a solid coin.  I sold when my investment more than doubled a few days ago; and I knew exactly where that money needed to go.

Our dog has been the happiest little wheelchair user since she became paralyzed three years ago. We had the one in the pic custom made for her, and it's amazing. It has big wheels that give her a lot of stability and help when she's outdoors -- it's great for hikes -- but it's about twice as wide as she is. Watching her get stuck or hung up on furniture and corners when she's inside breaks my heart.

She's getting older, and I want her to have assistance that makes indoor movement extra easy for her. So I was just able to use my TEL earnings to order a simpler cart with a smaller frame. 

Some people might say this is a frivolous purchase. Or maybe that I should have continued to hodl instead of selling. But I get so much joy from making our dog happier that it's 100% worth taking action now so my pup can live her best life.

For about as long as I've been coming here (not that long tbh), slagging on Doge, Safemoon, or Shiba Inu has been an easy way to get karma. But does DOGE deserve to be lumped in with those other two? Would you consider it a shitcoin?

I've read the pros and cons that the automod bot links (actually pretty helpful, recommended to anyone wanting to learn more of the fundamentals behind a coin), and they've kind of confirmed my suspicions that doge is getting a raw deal from the general population here.

It's stood the test of time, outliving a ton of other promising coins, *it's actually being used* as a currency, it's not as ""unlimited"" as its detractors claim... so what's the deal, does the hate mostly come from the fact that Elon took up its cause? That it's brought in the uneducated masses that get carried away in their sub? Basically, are we being hipsters here hating on something because it got popular?

And for a personal anecdote - on one of the bigger exchanges here in Canada (NDAX), DOGEcoin is currently the cheapest crypto to transfer out of the 16 they offer, even cheaper than XLM.

A big part of that is coming from the fact that the balance of cryptocurrency on exchanges, namely BTC and ETH, continues to fall. When there's a shortage of supply, volatility tends to spike.

As such, I would not advise trading under these conditions, nor would I even pay much attention to the day to day moves, and certainly not anything happening on the hourly. It will do a number on your mental health (believe me). The solution then? Zoom out. Focus on the weekly. Keep your cool. Watch those big moving averages.

Further to the first point, volatility means that crypto exchanges are put under pressure. Earlier this week, Binance suddenly went down for ""maintenance"" as is often the case when the market gets hot. A few of my mates didn't have the best of times with that to say the least, and it's not an issue that's unique to Binance. We see Coinbase going through this constantly!

Exchanges have a habit of going down, or suddenly asking you for KYC, or not being able to withdraw, etc. etc. These are just a few of the top tips I discussed in my video about how to prepare for the bull market. I strongly recommend you [give that a watch](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/CIWEu37tdtWH9-rcZeJ16x1UzXpKE-xWcMHoBznBDof5jFA3tQZYrAVdaTTR5qf6pB68bELukpcjIdbZBgjMUrN4iog_63J7SFiO-DwOin6pjknq61eCCURJMU-3UWJ1IUwGP9a5_B_3eJJfUVKYLQknZ5lEQwRr2VhKeYgE_A-eUXZ__r1mE1BNB8G9nj-b1kF1tkU5dgY) ASAP.

Another thing to keep in mind is how much regulators are closing in on the crypto sector. I've heard and seen a lot of chatter about keeping your crypto gains in stablecoins in an attempt to avoid tax, or even just to sit on during the bear market. I **do not** recommend this whatsoever.

Firstly, because you should not be evading tax and secondly because you could get caught. Stablecoins are front and center for regulators like the SEC and [the FATF](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/WmzTVZkAkSj6XsmIP47jnyw_9Qrb3H4CkedT0cFT28GwEW8BIB5iUwaWOxhNYMbuPiUzMeJ6JaT9uae-coxsaMCcba_QvLFLwkAts3HO2u-aUinWbF_g1rCAVKgTFh6yIoBvzX_tx3gSXShW7ij4lhJ28qXImLOgASNxHBR_c1pYRXjJgXs2Eq-8AohgKSFYl0V5EZUsLTYpF37pVJQRUAU), and especially now that Circle has announced plans to become a fully regulated digital bank. It is not inconceivable that KYC could be coming to anyone who's holding USDC in their personal wallet.

These centralized stablecoin issuers have previously frozen user accounts on behalf of authorities, and the last thing you want is to get caught with your pants down.

Now, if we see new all-time highs in the coming weeks, your family and friends will probably come to you again asking for advice about what to buy, when to sell, or even just how to make back their losses. I know it's tempting to help those that you care about, but you have to be clear that you're not giving them any financial advice.

You might be able to handle the volatility, but retail investors definitely can't. If having them constantly come to you every time the price changes isn't stressful enough, just wait if they fail to sell before the price starts to fall.

A few days ago there was news that Gary Gensler said that the SEC is more likely to approve Bitcoin futures ETFs over spot ETFs. There are a few things I don't understand about this that I'm hoping someone can explain.

1. I recently saw in the news that Bank of America is already providing Bitcoin futures to some of their clients. How is what they are already providing different than what the SEC would need to approve?
2. Why would the SEC approve a futures ETF but not a spot ETF? I'm sure part of it has to do with regulation, but what is it about futures ETFs that gives them more control?
3. It's my understanding that futures trading is riskier than spot trading, but I also know that one of the arguments that the SEC uses is that it needs to regulate to protect investors. If futures are a riskier investment, how does this work with that argument?
4. Why is it that other countries, like Canada and Brazil, are able to get spot ETFs easily, but it's more complicated here?

This crypto trading algorithm scans the Binance exchange for coins every 20 seconds, and if a recent innovation listing is found it will automatically place a buy order.

The bot will also be able to sell the coin at the optimum time by using a trailing stop loss. Essentially, as long as the price of the coin is going up, the algo will hold onto the coin, and sell once it detects a trend reversal.

I'm sure many of you have noticed the phenomenon of massive pumps the moment a new asset is listed on Binance, only to be followed by a significant drop afterwards. Manually trading that would be impossible, but a trading bot might be able to capitalize on some sweet gains there.

It comes with a test mode too so you can plug it in and let it run without any risk of using real money as you're testing it.

The bot is written in Python and works with Binance and Binance US.

I've been testing it for a couple of days, but no coins have been listed on Binance since then, but I will continue testing it and report back. Though every function has been individually tested in the past and proven to work from some of my other projects. So please bear that in mind if you give it a go yourself.

Since the market is growing so fast there will be increasing demand for different niches of cloud data storage also. Crypto enabled data storage projects are surely one niche that will gain more users in the future and I would like to know how you guys see the future of current players in the market.

I have made myself quite well aware of Filecoin, Siacoin, Storj and Opacity Storage but I would like to hear if there’s some other projects out there that target this growing market so let me know which projects I should dig into and why.

So far my thoughts about the projects mentioned earlier are something like that:

**Filecoin**

\+ Decentralized

\+ Well known by everyone in crypto and has backers with know names (Winklevoss brothers)

\+ Well funded

\+ Relying into well known IPFS standard

\- Not user friendly product ready so far

\- Quite big portion of decentralized nodes operate in China

\- Limitations of IPFS limit also services built on top of Filecoin platform

Learn more: filecoin.io

**Siacoin**

\+ Decentralized

\+ Well known

\+ Possible to build own products using Sia as backend

\- Not user friendly product where you could pay with Siacoin so far

\- Not anonymous product ready yet

\- Focus might be too much spread between storage product and Skynet

Learn more: sia.tech

**Storj**

\+ Decentralized

\+ Focused on object storage so it’s easy to do marketing and develop the product

\- Expensive to use

\- Focused for developers so relies very much of development outside of Storj

Learn more: storj.io

**Opacity Storage**

\+ Very easy to use through web browser and no mandatory application installations needed

\+ Fast to set up account and use

\+ Mobile apps for IOS and Android will be released in few weeks

\+ Desktop apps for Windows and Mac will be released in few weeks

\+ Possible to build own services on top of Opacity Storage

\- Not yet decentralized. Currently storing files on AWS but they are testing to let user to choose data to be stored on Sia. Own decentralized nodes coming to test later in this year

\- Not well known

Welcome to a revolutionary Bitcoin Token - Bitcoin Eco [BTCE]

Bitcoin Eco [BTCE] is LAUNCHING on 20 Aug 2021. A token that is based on BEP-20 Binance Smart Chain and self-mining protocol. Bitcoin Eco announces with a great pleasure that it supports a 100% of environmentally friendly practices and strategies to support the mother nature.

Mining and How it Works:

BTCE offers mining through a transparent and a fair system. BTCE is auto-mineable and proud to announce a tremendous MAGICAL structure of daily, weekly, and monthly rewards system like never before. BTCE rewards its holders by 0.40%, 2%, and 3% for daily, weekly and monthly intervals respectively.

**💬 Telegram:** [https://t.me/InuViking](https://t.me/InuViking)

**What is INUVIKING ?**

INUVIKING ($INUV) is a new BSC token designed to simultaneously make you great friends and great gains. They’re putting a huge emphasis on positive social interactions and stamping out abuse, shaming and prejudice.

We want to create a coin that will be a safe investment for all. Not just a quick in-and-out stop for your money.

**Passive Rewards (RFI) :**

The holders are automatically rewarded more $INUV by holding. This is done by charging a 7% tax on all transactions. 2% will go to holders, while 5% gets added back into the liquidity pool, creating a never ending pump!

Our aim is to keep building our liquidity pool stronger, this will benefit both the community and the team.

The most common pattern is that of failure. With coins being made every day, it is unsurprising that the majority of these projects end up going nowhere. Even worse than this, many of these coins turn out to be nothing more than scams, designed to separate people from their hard earned money. But what about the successful projects? what do they have in common? This is one of, if not the most important question to know the answer to when deciding where to put your money. 
 
During my time in the crypto community, I have noticed three major factors that contribute to the success of a project. The first and most important factor is the community that surrounds the coin. This includes devs, moderators, and community members alike. Without a team of hard working people, a project will go nowhere. The quality of the team is huge in determining how well the coin will perform. Just as important however, if not more important is the quantity, or size of the community itself.  You can have the best idea in the world, but without anyone to hear it, nobody will know. It is the coins that have both a high quality dev team, and a large and enthusiastic community that stand the best change of becoming the next success story in crypto. 
 
Another major factor is the coin itself. What are the tokenomics like? Who developed this coin? Can it be dumped? Is this a safe investment? These are all questions that all need to be answered before investing in a coin. The projects that have succeeded in recent months are those with whale taxes, anti dump tokenomics, and regular paid out reflections. The most successful projects are also those developed by professionals with a deep understanding of their field. The reason for this is obvious; the crypto community is flooded with scammers. When devs really know what they're doing, it is shown in the way they conduct themselves, and their competence is demonstrated by the performance of their coin. 
 
The third factor of determining a coins success is the idea behind the project itself. What is its utility? What does this project offer outside of its value as an investment? For some coins, the answer is nothing. Many projects get away with not having any actual use or ideas outside of their coin. This model has succeeded in the past, but is now in the process of dying off. This I see as a good thing. Without any real function, these projects are nothing more than ponzi schemes in cool outfits. For a coin to be truly successful, it has to be part of a larger project or platform that has value outside of the coin.  
 
In summary, the three factors shared by nearly all successful projects are a strong community, a well developed coin, and a functional value that goes beyond the coin itself. With all these bases covered, I believe it would be incredibly difficult to fail. 
 
The project that I see currently hitting all these marks is called Ronin. Developed by a team of professionals who have had full careers in relevant fields, Ronin is so much more than a coin. Ronin is an ecosystem that hosts NFT based gaming. These are created by people at the top of their field in game design. Not only does this model appeal to people who have an interest in online gaming, but it allows digital creators to earn money with their artwork, and brings together people from all different niches. 
 
The community has been growing at an exponential rate. With AMAs taking place at a minimum frequency of once per week, the community around Ronin has proven itself to be strong and active. Currently the project has not yet launched. The strategy of the Ronin team is to build up the strongest community possible before launch, and carry the momentum until the very end. With the tokenomics in place, it is my belief that this lunch will be a massive success. The way Ronin aims to prevent large dumps is by implementing a 20% sell off limit every two hours. This means that the coin could decrease in value by at most 20%. This will of course not happen, as it would require everyone to sell the max amount of coins at once. With these measures in place, I would be astonished if this coin does not multiply in value by a substantial degree.  
 
For more information on Ronin, I would highly encourage you to watch their AMA. I believe that the best way to properly evaluate a coin is to familiarize yourself with the devs, and get a sense of how they operate, conduct themselves, and run their project. Also linked below is their telegram group, which I would encourage you to join. There will be another AMA this Sunday at 7 PM PST. People always say to do research but it is rare that anyone does. Well now you can. Attend the Ronin AMA, or watch the previous AMA, and decide if this is a coin and team you would like to invest in.

The AMA can be found by searching “Ronin AMA” on YouTube. It is the one that is an hour long. The telegram can be found by searching “roningamez”"|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|581112|public|self|How to ACTUALLY DYOR|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/p4ky87/how_to_actually_dyor/|all_ads|6|1628973586.0|support||Support-Open|||||||||||2021-08-15 02:09:46+00:00|t3_p4ky87|0|1|0.56||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||15_08_21|08_21|0.08798095|0.4706187|0.44140035|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.05708480626344681|0.21451924741268158|0.014078743755817413|0.21398550271987915|0.4815766215324402|0.01875513233244419

It’s true that everyone has to do their due diligence before investing in ANYTHING. But still, it is a platform’s duty to also make sure it’s not listing shady projects.

The amount of scam coins on popular and “respected” exchange platforms is unbelievable. And you’d think they have enough resources to come up with an AI to catch these scams. I mean we have relatively smaller projects like ChilliSwap with AIs and algorithms that monitor a project’s behavior to see if it’s a scam or not, yet you’re telling me that major exchange platforms can’t do the same ? Something smells fishy. I guess it’s just profitable for them that way, smh.already have that so what’s the excuse."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|581383|public|self|I blame exchange platforms for the scam coin phenomenon.|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/p50txv/i_blame_exchange_platforms_for_the_scam_coin/|all_ads|6|1629038626.0|discussion|d990f59a-aa4d-11e3-bb1c-12313d053130|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-08-15 20:13:46+00:00|t3_p50txv|0|12|0.84||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||15_08_21|08_21|0.11373047|0.41845116|0.46781844|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.04209398850798607|0.06655336916446686|0.0036040658596903086|0.8177513480186462|0.06688778847455978|0.0031094748992472887
