|Classic rug pull Comedy post - stating they are selling only to switch it at the end and say ""only to buy more crypto""|45,500|

so looking at these we begin to see a pattern, the most up voted post are ones that get emotional reactions from from the readers. Most people can relate to hardships with banks or the pain of missing out on a project. 

Another thing we notice is that readers up vote rags to riches story's, people like to see the underdog win. They also like to see rich snobs get put in their place by other rich snobs, so post about one millionaire calling out another one can be good for moon farming.

News and Technical analysis also seem to get lucky sometimes and make it to the top, but not as often as you would think. Below I have assembled a list of key words and phrases to include in your title's to help get those Moon's.

If you have gotten this far then you are really dedicated to becoming a real life moon farmer and you want to one day make your living shit posting on Reddit. I can not guarantee your success, I can only show you what seems to work for other.

* Post and interesting news article (search before posting news articles, they get posted multiple times)
* post about a celebrity using crypto (this one work some times)
* post a rug pull story
* unpopular and popular opinions seem to be loosing popularity (proceed with caution)
* Rag to riches story will work 50% of the time
* If all else fails, post about moon week (This one always works, just make sure no one else has posted it in the last 2 hours)

Remember that although moon farming is difficult work, one day it will pay off (it might not, nobody actually knows if moons will ever have any real value)

If you read this entire post, you are now an official moon farmer.

This is aimed at being educational (not financial advice) so there is no TL;DR. If you want to learn more about DeFi read on.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago I made a post about DeFi and why folks should be paying attention to it and it got a decent amount of attention. A comment I saw come up quite a bit was how people still didn't really understand what exploring the DeFi space meant. There seemed to be interest in learning more about DeFi but not a lot of resources on getting started. Therefore I decided to write a multipart series breaking down DeFi for newcomers and explaining how to actually use the space. This first part will really focus on what Defi is and define a few things to get us all on the same page.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is DeFi? Defi is a movement that allows people to use financial services (borrowing, lending, trading) without the need of a centralized entity like a bank. These services are generally provided by Decentralized Apps (DApps), generally deployed on the Ethereum Network.

&amp;#x200B;

So we know what DeFi is but that's still pretty broad. So what are all the parts of DeFi? Good question. Let's break it down into several categories.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Stablecoins - coins that are pegged to stable assets such as the US dollar. USDT is by far the most popular in terms of use but there are a few other options such as USDC, DAI, and BUSD. While stable coins are DApps themselves, they do make accessibility into DeFi easier since crypto can be extremely volatile
2. Lending and Borrowing - DeFi removes the restrictions that are created by banks when it comes to lending and borrowing money. It also allows people that don't have access to a bank the ability to lend and borrow. Things like credit score become irrelevant in this space. The only thing you need is crypto assets to participate. You can earn a yield by depositing assets and you can borrow against assets you stake in protocols.
3. Exchanges - Centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance work as intermediaries and custodians of traded assets. This means your assets are on their platform and they are technically in control of your assets (not your keys, not your crypto). DEXs (decentralized exchanges) allow users to exchange crypto without giving up custody of your coins. Since your funds stay with you, you don't need to trust that the exchange remains solvent.
4. Lottery - DeFi Lottery Daaps have started popping up as DeFi continues to disrupt finance. These Dapps allow users to pool their funds together and invest in a lending app earning interest. At a set interval a random winner is selected to win. all the funds earned in the pool. The ""tickets"" are then refunded to all participants creating a ""no-loss"" lottery. Sidenote: There is a loss here and that's the opportunity of earning those rewards by staking yourself.
5. Governance - this is the business management of crypto. Think like a board of directors except anyone who owns a governance token for an Daap has voting rights. 

There are a few other categories that can fall under the DeFi umbrella but these are in my opinion some of the more popular ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before we get into how to access Dapps and participate in Defi, we need to have an understanding of the Decentralized Layer. Many blockchains give people the ability to build Dapps using their blockchain but Ethereum is by far the most popular so let's start there. Ethereum allows software developers to write smart contracts on the Ethereum block chain. Smart Contracts is essentially a programmable contract that allows two parties to set conditions of a transaction without the trust of an outside party. For example, when you buy a home, a title company is generally responsible for the transfer of assets between both parties. A smart contract would eliminate the need for the title company and handle the transfer all on the blockchain.

Multiple smart contracts are combined together to work hand in hand to create a decentralized application (DApp). This allows Dapps to handle complex processes.

&amp;#x200B;

Dapps have a number of pros and cons to them just like most things in life.

**Advantages**

1. Immutability -  once it's deployed on the blockchain it cant be changed
2. Tamper-proof - cant be tampered with without everyone on the blockchain knowing
3. Transparency - they are openly auditable (many developers have third parties audit their code)
4. Availability - Dapps built on ETH will remain usable as long as ETH remains active

**Disadvantages**

1. Immutability - Human errors are common and as mentioned above, once deployed a contract can't be changed
2. Transparent - transparency can also lead to hackers finding exploits in the code
3. Scalability - Dapps are generally limited to the bandwidth available on the blockchain it lives on

A few example of Dapps include AAVE, MAKER, Compound, Anchor Protocol, and Curve Finance.

 Most Dapps are plug and play. You go to their site and you connect your wallet and you're good to use the platform. As far as wallets go, MetaMask is the most popular option available. If you don't have a MetaMask wallet I would recommend opening one up. Coinbase Wallet is also an option and for mobile Argent wallet is a good option.

In a later post I will go over how to participate in some of these protocols. Due to Ethereum gas fees this can be pretty expensive. Luckily, there are a few options to make this cheaper. Layer 2 solutions exist to help us out with this. Ill briefly discuss what Layer 1 and Layer 2.

**Layer 1 (L1)** \- this is the term used to describe the underlying main blockchain architecture. In our case this would be the Ethereum blockchain.

**Layer 2 (L2)** \- is the term used to describe a network built on top of another blockchain. Examples of this would be the Matic, Arbitrum, or Avalanche networks. They are all built on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows them access to all the Ethereum network provides such as liquidity. Fees are generally much lower on these networks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2 will go over some of these protocols, what they offer, and how to use them. So keep an eye out. If there is anything you'd like me to cover in this series or if there is anything you'd like for me to expand upon from this post feel free to ask below. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was many people in here that wanted the prices to go a bit lower so they could buy up some more and HERE IS YOUR CHANCE. The buying volume going on at the moment is crazy, we could go as low as 53K USD to shake out all the leverages but I doubt it. 

Make no mistake about it this is a fantastic opportunity to fill your bags up a bit more. If you don’t wish to that’s fine just don’t make the mistake of FOMOing in later and paying a higher price.

I've started trading in crypto for the past year or so but don't talk about it much at home, except recently when my parents started seeing news about crypto (like the Staples, Crypto-dot-com thing). So when they learned that I use part of my salary to get into crypto, they told me I shouldn't fall for the hype and just keep my money safe.

EXCEPT I've read enough stories from this sub and outside of people getting money in crypto and even company owners saying [blockchain has potential in foreign exchanges](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2431572328617/blockchain-is-a-natural-fit-for-dao-like-structures-unhashed-18), and the fact that many companies are starting to get into crypto. Even my kid relatives are playing NFT games (Axie Infinity) to earn!!!

Now that the market is currently in a dip, I don't want to miss the chance of my parents earning more before they retire in a few years. I hate that they prefer saving/keeping money in the bank, and I know they can get more out of their money if they learn crypto. I don't know where to start convincing them. I know they'll be hesitant because of the Great Recession and now COVID, but I'd like to shoot my shot since I don't know when this opportunity will appear again.

But today Charles Hoskinson released a video titled [calm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf2C4fq4ZY4) and it really got me thinking. 

A lot of us have thought about timing the top, and how great it would be to 10,000x and run away with a hundred million dollars. Whenever we miss selling the top, our gut sinks. What you don't realize is that even if you timed it *PERFECTLY*, what you'd be running back to is a failed monetary system. Fiat currency is doomed. This isn't some tinfoil hat type of take, it's really doomed. ***HALF of the USD's circulating supply was printed in the last two years alone.*** 

I'm really starting to think that this bull run has little to do with the 4 year cycle Bitcoin has undergone in the past decade. No. This is millions of well funded investors abandoning fiat currency. Now is the time to rediscover what we're really fighting for: decentralization. 

Charles pointed out the strength and positivity shown by the Cardano community. Despite it not giving insane returns when everything else was moving, all of us continued following the project and staying involved in whatever way we can. Whether it be through voting, staking, or just simply listening to each other. We continued to support each other, knowing that our eyes are set on the next decade of growth.

Don't get me wrong, some Cardano projects found new life in this positive atmosphere. Many are prospering. Hosky and Catjam have helped bring in thousands of new users. Catjam has started growing into one of the most positive communities I've ever been a part of.

It is a way of distilling market information to make a better decision on purchasing or selling an asset.

In its purest form, it involves looking at a chart, identifying price trends, confirming if the trends you see are valid, and making a trading decision based on that info. Sounds great—look at the charts, figure out the future price. Easy enough. 

In reality, though, it’s a bit more tricky. Millions of market participants are playing the same game, all looking for an edge, all trading on their own psychology, with ridiculous amounts of static between the signal and you. 

# The Data Supporting Technical Analysis

A lot of more TradFi-type ETF investors will tell you that technical analysis is totally meaningless. I don’t think this is the case. Plenty of academic (and anecdotal) evidence tells us TA outperforms passive investing strategies.

Most data we have on the discipline comes from equity markets. While there are definitely academics that say TA is worthless, the following studies have all confirmed that basic TA can outperform passive strategies:

* Errunza and Losq ([1985](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037842668590007X?via%3Dihub))
* Urrutia ([1995](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6803.1995.tb00568.x)) 
* Sobreiro et al. ([2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062940816300742?via%3Dihub))
* Noakes and Rajaratnam ([2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10479-014-1751-y))

Most recently, 2018 study [de Souza, M.J.S., Ramos, D.G.F., Pena, M.G. *et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40854-018-0087-z) made the following conclusion on a broad review of TA strategies in BRICS equity markets:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“On average, the returns obtained using technical analysis surpassed the value invested.”

&amp;#x200B;

These studies sometimes contradict each other, but pretty much all of them have commonalities:

* TA is more effective when performed in less efficient markets 
* Higher frequency of trading is correlated with lower returns via TA
* TA aided by fundamental analysis is more effective
* TA is more effective in less mature markets

Perhaps these points help explain why TA is so effective in crypto markets, especially with altcoins. Altcoin markets are immature, less efficient, and can be evaluated fundamentally. Retail investors have a further advantage in that they don’t need to make frequent trades.

&amp;#x200B;

**When is Technical Analysis Valid?**

I don't think the average crypto investor can make their whole trading career out of technical analysis, but it can definitely help you:

* Inform longer-term investment decisions alongside fundamental analysis
* Help you time exits
* Get better entry points for swing trades.

All of these advantages are valuable enough that it’s worth understanding, at minimum, the basic foundations.

&amp;#x200B;

**A Note**

In this analysis, I’m going to be starting from the most basic technical analysis concepts. If you already understand technical analysis, this article might just be a way to brush up on the basics or one to skip.

## The Foundation: Supply and Demand

All technical analysis comes down to one thing: understanding supply and demand. If there are more buyers (demand) than sellers (supply), the price will move upwards. More demand than supply? The price will go up. Much of technical analysis comes down to identifying where that supply and demand lies and making your investment based on that info.

I find it a healthy exercise to reflect on the fact that, in every trade, there is one buyer and one seller: for any investment idea you have, there is someone on the other side thinking the exact opposite. And one of you will be wrong.  It's a humbling concept, but one that will definitely make you think twice.

## Resistance/Support

When a cryptocurrency bounces off a certain price level twice, that could indicate a place of resistance or support. That is to say, there are a lot of people looking to trade at that price and the crypto will have a harder time breaking out above or falling below.

**Resistance**

Resistance is the tendency for an asset to approach a given price and fall back down just before or right after hitting it. It often happens at round numbers, because sellers concentrate supply around prices like $100 or $1000 or $60,000. 

Check out the example below where Bitcoin bounced off of its previous all-time high (resistance) before breaking through:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l84jknsc1g081.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f11b8ba8efe1a8b59ca15b11e77cde7ce1d41ae8

**Support**

Once a crypto breaks through a resistance price level, it often becomes support. Support is a floor that an asset’s price bounces off of. This can represent a good buying opportunity because frequently, after a crypto makes this critical test, momentum changes. Many investors wait for that bounce to make a directional trade and buy at the lowest possible price.

For an example, check out the chart below for Ethereum, where it broke through, then bounced off, the $3,000 price level for a few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I like this tweet from Three Arrows Capital investor Su Zhu on trading support and resistance:

&amp;#x200B;

# Channels

Channels are just what they sound like, two wals of prices that an asset is range-bound within. 

Channels can trend up, down, or sideways. When channels trend sideways, it’s often seen as an opportunity to accumulate a crypto.

When these channels exist, there are a few possibilities for making money: 

* Make a trade at the bottom hoping for a bounce
* Make a trade at the top hoping for a rejection
* Make a directional trade after a breakout

# Breakouts

A breakout happens when a crypto moves above a support area or below a resistance area. When identified correctly, this tends to be accompanied by a big move, either up or down, and thus a big opportunity. It happens a lot when a crypto hits, and then passes, an all-time high.

Below is a chart of Bitcoin last year where it encountered resistance at its 2017 ATH, then broke out with a big move to the upside:

&amp;#x200B;

# 

# Moving Averages

Like price levels of support and resistance, moving averages are often areas of resistance and support as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Simple Moving Average**

The concept of a simple moving average is, well, actually a little complicated: it is the “arithmetic moving average calculated by adding recent prices and then dividing that figure by the number of time periods in the calculation.” It's basically the average price over the last period of time, plotted on a continuous line. 

These moving averages end up being bands of prices that sit below the asset price in bullish times and above the asset price in bearish times.

If you’ve ever heard the term ‘death cross’ or ‘golden cross,’ it comes from moving averages. Golden crosses are when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average to the upside, and often signals a pump in price. Death crosses are when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average to the downside. 

You can see the chart below as an example of what moving averages look like on a chart as well as what it looks like when they cross.

https://preview.redd.it/ekrp0ijh1g081.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aab2439c71f0ff5ca9449b992e048f233305f26f

**Exponential Moving Average**

The EMA is similar to the SMA, although it places more weight on recent prices. It’s used in a similar way, to find buy and sell signals when it serves as resistance or support or when it crosses another moving average.

## Volume 

You know those little bars at the bottom of a price chart, below the graph? Those bars reflect volume--the amount of a given cryptocurrency, in dollars, traded over a time period.  

Volume can help us detect momentum—a word used when a trend in a cryptocurrency is accompanied by large volume. 

Increased volume signals that whatever trend you're seeing is important. With more volume, we can see that more and more participants are pricing in new information, and that more participants are entering or exiting the market for that asset. 

A price drop on very low volume probably isn’t a huge reason to be concerned. A price drop on enormous volume means there’s something big happening. See the May Ethereum selloff for a good example of how high volume signaled a short bear market:

 

https://preview.redd.it/2ocbfd7m1g081.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc77a0e40939f05afadfe81c08d5a78eddcd3c04

# RSI

RSI is a stat that ranges between 1 and 100 and attempts to show momentum. The calculation is a bit rough, but the basic idea is that if RSI is above 70, the crypto is overbought and might be due for a trend reversal. Below 30 and it could be undervalued, ready to pull out of a downward slide.

It's a bit more nuanced and must be used in conjunction with price data to be well understood. The fact that cryptos can remain 'overbought' or 'undervalued' for long periods of time makes it even more difficult to get right.

# Platforms for Technical Analysis

For charting, TradingView is definitely the most popular service and it’s free, although it’s got a premium subscription available. The charts in this article all came from TradingView. Coinigy and Cryptowat.ch are also well-known services. I'd recommend TradingView just because it's so widely used. 

# The Limitations (and Infinite Possibilities) of Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a tree that branches out in endless directions. On-chain analysts (market observers that look at public blockchain data) combine TA with other metrics. They combine these new metrics to make even more metrics derived from the first layer of TA statistics. It can make your head spin.

There are so many signals and patterns to identify that it often becomes difficult to find the patterns that are really important. As with everything, it comes down to practice, experience, introspection, research, and learning.

It’s really, really difficult to become a trader on solely technical analysis. When your money is on the line, it’s easy to get emotional or overinvested in a narrative. An altcoin that’s pumping is really hard to sell and will look like it can go forever. Stories can be constructed in your own head.

I think TA is best used in combination with other skills: position sizing, fundamental analysis, diversification, profit taking. It's another way to improve your arsenal as an investor, not a golden bullet.

first, even if I saw a ten percent profit, I would sell it. Later, when I realized that this was not a good option, I decided to keep it for the long term and continue without taking any profit. 

After a long time, I bought a new coin -LRC. It was 0.97 when I bought it. While I had a good profit, I made no sales and I did not take any profits. Maybe this will work for me in the long run, but the psychological situation in the short run is a bit severe. 

If you have invested more than you can afford to lose, feel free to take a profit. Taking a profit is not a bad thing. Before investing in any coin, set a goal for yourself and know how to stop yourself when you reach that goal. You can evaluate the ideas of others, but do not put them ahead of your own.

Or how many beginners wrote it down on a torn piece of paper to keep inside their wallet just ready to get stolen?

As a semi-newbie I started on an exchange, learned about limit and market orders, looked up interesting projects, then bought my first crypto. That was A LOT of info to absorb and understand for me. 

It wasn't until a few months down the line when I became confident I knew about wallets and started storing crypto outside of exchanges. 

I hope most people are smarter than me, but if I tried to open a wallet right at the start then I probably would've kept the seed phrase in my wallet and not secure it properly.

But I realized that after the MAY crash earlier this year, my emotions spinning around like crazy is nowhere near sustainable.

I just decided to pick solid stuff I believe in and let it sit, I made profits earlier in the year even with the downturn after May, I learned a valuable lesson. Take profits when your gut tells you it's time and don't take everything out if you don't quite feel ready.

That's where I'm at now, I don't have that much in yet, but my stance will stay the same. At this stage whether it rains bears or bulls, I don't care either way because I'll be winning.

 Just DCA if you genuinely believe in something and if you are a bit scared atm, it's natural, set your price targets (what you're willing to lose/ win) and don't let anyone tell you different.

The bullet list is what I'm thinking… what do you guys think? How would you invest it?   


Once most of these games release, they prob will have another run up huh? Then they will all consolidate/rise long term based on what people actually enjoy playing.   


I’m looking at going all in SANDBOX or STAR ATLAS with $3k. Also, even though the narrative is around metaverse, what projects are actually looking to be used in VR? I know VRChat is another popular metaverse but isn’t on the blockchain to invest in.  


* **MANA / DECENTRALAND** \- The obvious leader in a decentralized metaverse, I’d say like the bitcoin equivalent.
* **SANDBOX** \- Prob a better play now for ROI, the ethereum equivalent. Brands buying virtual real estate here. It’s still only 2.6 billion in market cap compared to MANA’s 5 billion market cap. Lots of room to grow still yeah?
* **NTVRK** \- Just went through the dip a bit… You can buy space, land, ads, nfts, staking. Focus on virtual reality and augmented reality. They’re not just focused in the game side version of metaverse but the roadmap extends into virtual and augmented reality where the metaverse will start evolving into. MANA is only 2D.
* **CUBE** \- Metaverse that actually has VR capabilities.
* **WILDER WORLD** \- Graphics look dope. The price does seem extremely volatile. Not yet released.
* **STAR ATLAS** \- High budget looking space exploration game. Not yet released. Built on Solana… could have a nice run up.
* **GALA** \- They create blockchain games. Still only 7 cents. Price is moving slow.
* **ILLUVIUM** \- Built on the ethereum blockchain. Turned based game. Not yet released.
* **MVI** \- A metaverse index with a bunch of metaverse based projects. Seems like the safest investment. Slow and steady.
* **RNDR** \- Graphics engine built for the metaverse.
* **BLOK** \- Cyberpunk skyscraper. Still not released. Graphics look a bit meh… It’s highest was 16 cents and been on a downtrend since then.
* **REDFOX** \- Just went through a big dip so it has a good entry price right now. Possible potential for gains.
* **ENJ** \- Could be the safest long term play. Might not have the momentum for gains anymore though. Fundamentally it’ll be useful for centralized and decentralized games to create NFTS. Less niche and more longer play.
* **SHIRYO INU** \- Fantasy NFT trading card game. Super early entry. Fractions of a cent.
* **MERIT CIRCLE** \- Partnering with Illuvium, Star Atlas, and Axie Infinity. Seems like it could be vital for gaming and play to earn.
* **UFO** \- Fractions of a cent.. not yet super accessible to buy. Community owned.
* **VRA** \- Currently 7 cents, could hit 25 cents?
* **OVR** \- Mapping the real world virtually that you can scan the world with your phone.
* **METAHERO** \- Trending on Tiktok. Another thing that scans real world objects.
* **KALAO** \- Avalanches metaverse."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3934850|public|self|What's the next metaverse play with high ROI left in it?

It was easy to DCA back then as I could see my average buy going lower and lower. However, now, in this crash, I am still green and am contemplating if I should DCA in or not. What do you guys do? 

Some of my mates DCA no matter what others only DCA when the crypto dear index is below 50. Right now I am tempted to buy but just cannot do it as it would increase my average buying price. Most people do not like the red but here I just love it and I am praying to God Almighty for the value to go lower so I can lower my average price. 

Those of you who can DCA despite the price moving up is something I just cannot do, especially when the bull starts going parabolic. Kudos to those lads.

Is it a known fact that Technical Analysis is a self fulfilling prophecy as opposed to a tool for modeling?  TA doesn’t predict price action, it causes the price action.  The more universally accepted a chart is, the more accurate it will end up being.  Correlation or causation.  I think it’s cause.  The chart that everyone is using says a crash will happen at X so a group of people who really believe this is accurate sell at X.  Then others follow them in selling because they are seeing the selling the chart said they’d see.  And there’s the dip.  Then the trash scared asses get shook out.  Then liquidations.  And you have a crash.  One caused by the chart, not predicted by it.  Same with support.  Breakouts.  Etc.

I saw earlier that this might not be as widely understood in this space as I would have expected, and imo it's a really important distinction (especially for making good investments), so here we go!    

The different ways of understanding monetary ""value"" are important in the world of crypto. Crypto (some of it) doesn't solely have the value that individual people collectively agree it has. Fiat, also, does not have value because 'everyone says it does', that's a common simplification.    

""Fiat"", the word, essentially means ""by decree"", or more colloquially, ""because an authority says so"". That falls under ""inherent value"", or ""value that is applied to a thing"". Fiat doesn't have intrinsic value, but it is deemed a currency by a state authority.    

Crypto doesn't have ""fiat"" value, but it does have inherent value: and I argue that some crypto has intrinsic value.    

Fiat does not have ""intrinsic value"", or ""value that is an immutable property of a thing"". It has no properties that give it value, other than the meager commodity value of the ink/paper/etc used to create it, which is worthless compared to it's fiat / inherent value -- unless your country experiences staggering levels of inflation, and money, say, needs to be burned for warmth. It then returns to being commodity money, because if the intrinsic value of the materials that make it up.    

Many things do have intrinsic value. A diamond, outside of it's inherent value, does have intrinsic value: it is one of the most durable materials on the planet. Food has intrinsic value because it's necessary for human life.     

It's not that individual citizens agree that fiat has value which matters --- it's that *governments* pass legislation/etc that says:    

1. This thing is money.     
2. You are required by law to use and accept it as currency in this country.     
3. It is the only thing you may use to pay us taxes.    

Fiat exists essentially as currency-by-threat. It's essentially money that is backed by the threat of state violence:    

Don't pay your taxes? You got problems.     

Refuse to pay? Prison and/or violence.
(i.e the state will use the threat of violence and imprisonment to coerce you to pay, and they'll fulfill that promise by sending state agents to demand payment, and eventually they may use force and imprisonment to coerce you to pay if you continue to refuse).    

Refuse to pay or be imprisoned? You hide, flee, or wind up as an extrajudicial state murder (if you meet the state's acts of violence with violent resistance of your own).    

[Along with this comes the reality that states maintain a monopoly on violence: it is legally allowed to harm, imprison, and kill you, and it is illegal for you to resist. But that's a whole other discussion.]    

All of that was a bit of a digression, but extremely important to understand in general.    

On the other hand, crypto can have both inherent *and* intrinsic value --- but not all of it has intrinsic value (and to be fair, this may be a loose interpretation of 'intrinsic' if you really get down to it, but idk a better word).    

What I'm getting at:    

Many crypto projects have blockchains which provide and maintain value that exists in them by their very nature. They can be tools, structures upon which to build, services, etc. Meaning they are intrinsically valuable because they have properties which are valuable.    

___ is valuable because it provides services that are of great value to large and profitable companies.     

___ has value as a structure which can provide finance and access to banking.    

___ has intrinsic value as a means of providing real anonymity of payment and receipt during transactions.    

These values exist in them, based on their use cases.    

On the other hand, memecoins and simple tokens only have *inherent* value, and a very shaky kind of inherent value at that. They provide no services, don't create structures on which to operate any tools or services. Their value rests solely on individual and collective agreement. That's why their pricing generally fluctuates so wildly, and why they are risky investments. 

Honestly that's why I avoid BTC; it has only inherent value, and I want everything that I hold to have intrinsic value. In my personal opinion, and on the long term, I see BTC as a sinking ship; as it loses Blue Chip status and is surpassed by intrinsically valuable blockchains. And even in the here and now, I don't really trust it enough to stand on it.

To wrap this up: Understanding the distinction's around value, money, fiat, crypto, and other classifications of exchange is exceptionally important in this space. It's a way to choose good investments, and a way to avoid the vague mental trap of ""all money has no value and neither does crypto"". There lies the path of the YOLO. 😔

Thanks for reading! I make no claim that any of this is perfectly correct, as I'm still reading and learning. This went longer than I expected, and it's a bit disorganized due to limited time for editing, but I hope it's useful!

Some of this perspective on currency came from the book ""Blockchains and Bitcoins"". Some good extra reading would be to look up the different types of currency (representative, fiat, commodity, etc), or pick up the book!"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3933635|public|self|"""Crypto Has No Actual Value"": A Friendly Rebuttal"|0|[]|0.71|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qx2u09/crypto_has_no_actual_value_a_friendly_rebuttal/|all_ads|6|1637259000.0||||||||||||2021-11-18 23:40:00+00:00|t3_qx2u09|0|11||

The exchanges would then give the liquidity earned to Tether to compensate for all the USDT they occasionally print so often. 

It would explain why USDT's backings isn't exactly 1:1. Should this be found out, all securities, trades and futures tied to Tether would crash tanking the market to lows you didn't think possible. It would be akin to 2008's housing sector collapse where debt from others was used as collateral(collateralized debt obligation)

I had a friend introduce me to crypto a few years ago but I was strapped for cashed and didn't have the money to gamble. He went all in at the time, he cashed out his 401k, everything in Bitcoin, and now he's in the Caribbean. He shared some investment advice, something like ""if you think one thing will grow faster than everything else, then don't diversify, just put all your eggs in the racecar"".

So I took a page from his book and sold all my stocks and my liquidity positions and put everything into eth. On November 11th when it was around $4700. Now I'm down 14% this week.

I listened to that voice and I’m praying it wasn’t some asshole hedgie ghost playing with my emotions.

I held. I hold. My portfolio is dying, but you only lose if you sell, right? Right? Right? 😂

Regardless, I’m proud of my coin choices. I did my own research, I bought projects with merit. I’ll keep DCAing through this dip, I just pray that’s what it is. 

Let this be a dip. Not crypto winter. I’ll hold either way, but damn would it be nice to have some money in the bank. Less credit card debt. More money to invest, and to enjoy some moments with my family.  

TL:DR 

It sucks right now for crypto. I’m praying for a bounce back. Either way, I’m not leaving. 

I’m working, nose to the grindstone. I’ll keep buying, even as it drops. I’ll DCA and believe in my choices. 

If you had enough conviction to buy a coin, have as much conviction to hold it through the storm. Add to your bag if you can. Not financial advice, but common frigging sense. 

Keep up the fight. I truly believe crypto is the future. However long it takes to blow up, I’ll use that time to build my stash. We are still very early. Most people know nothing of crypto. Imagine when the masses find out. Think of the money that pours in when adoption is widespread. If I’m wrong, tell me. I love a debate. But for me, wait it out. I’ll weather this storm for the gains I know I’ll see. Patience is 🔑

Their goal is to become the industry leading ZK powerhouse with their newly released Polygon Miden, an Ethereum-Compatible Rollup.  

This is the TL;DR: from their [announcement](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-announces-polygon-miden-a-stark-based-ethereum-compatible-rollup/):  

**Polygon Announces Polygon Miden**

&gt;We are excited to announce the newest member of the Polygon solution suite - Polygon Miden, an upcoming STARK-based, EVM-compatible rollup. The project is led by Bobbin Threadbare, former Facebook’s core ZK researcher who led the development of Winterfell. Today we are releasing Polygon Miden’s core component - Miden VM, the first open-source STARK-based VM. We will continue working and investing in this and other Polygon’s ZK-based efforts, with the ultimate goal of becoming the industry’s leading ZK powerhouse.  

Development is well underway and they've already released the 0.1 version of Miden VM, an early version aimed towards cutting edge developers, it'll also feature Multi-language support guaranteeing Ethereum-compatibility, one of the supported langauges will be The Move Language, a safe and reliable language developed for blockchains.  
  



**Privacy by design**

&gt;Even though Polygon Miden is first and foremost a scaling solution, we don’t want privacy to be an afterthought. We believe that privacy will become one of the most important topics in the industry once the pressing need for scaling is met to a satisfying extent, and we are planning and preparing for this.  

Polygon are implementing privacy which makes it possible to selectively reveal parts of a program while keeping the rest of the program private. Sounds very interesting to me.  

Polygon Miden is fully open-source, and the only fully open-source STARK-based scaling solution.  

Polygon are releasing new solutions constantly and they haven't even been around for very long, so far they've released:  

Polygon [PoS](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/getting-started/)  
Polygon [SDK](https://blog.polygon.technology/announcing-polygon-sdk-the-gateway-to-multi-chain-ethereum-8ad580ec387/)  
Polygon [Avail](https://blog.polygon.technology/introducing-avail-by-polygon-a-robust-general-purpose-scalable-data-availability-layer-98bc9814c048/)  
Polygon [Nightfall](https://blog.polygon.technology/ey-collaborates-with-polygon-to-co-develop-ethereum-scaling-solutions-and-enterprise-blockchains/)  
Polygon [Hermez](https://blog.polygon.technology/hermez-network-and-polygon-merge-becoming-polygon-hemrez/)  

And now Polygon [Miden](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-announces-polygon-miden-a-stark-based-ethereum-compatible-rollup/).

I only got into crypto back in April and like most newbies thought ""Wow, a money hack that only goes UP!"" and gleefully waltzed into the May Elon Crash.  I'll admit it, making a few hundred bucks on DOGE convinced me that this is a real thing and needs urgent attention.

I spent every waking hour just thinking about Crypto.  Researching the fundamentals of the industry, and individual coins.  I had money sitting in my savings account and thought what the HELL am I doing with it there wasting away with 0.5% interest (technically negative because of inflation).  So fuck it, I YOLO'd what I could spare into the market.

And then, as I mentioned, everything dropped.  MANNNN that was demoralizing.  But thanks to this group and many others like Michael Saylor and Plan B's Stock to Flow (and also the dude who runs the Thinking Crypto podcast who's always hella bullish), I kept the faith and just HELD ON FOR DEAR LIFE.

I got a little bonus at work and thought, fuck it, everything's on sale, let's go!  So I threw it all into crypto, just before it started to pump again.  In August I was finally back in the black and ready for the bull season.  

Here's where the story gets crazy.  In the meantime I tested everything out, I built my own bots with R, I made some complex ""exit strategy"" spreadsheets to work out which percentages I'd cash out each of my holdings at.  Then something funny happened.  I stay up late into the night working out my exit strategy and after two glasses of whisky I say, ""Nope, screw this!"" sold EVERYTHING, moved it all to Pionex (which has trading bots) and instead put it into coins I knew would pump soon.  So yes, I sold my large ADA hodling (sorry!!)

But I still had the HODL mentality.  It worked for a bit as things started to pump together.  I missed a few huge spikes, like the Metaverse pump.  I just held and thought ""MY PUMP WILL COME!"".  But the last straw was when everything dumped and I woke up in the morning with 20% less in my pocket.  I thought ""If I just moved everything to USDC for the night... argh!"" and that's when it hit me.  

I can sit around and wait, and sure that'll work out decently, but I can also go full strategic and move where the action is.  So I went full fluid mode.  I'm now almost always sitting in a stable coin, watching the market and sniping opportunities.  For example, the second I heard about crypto.com Arena, I went ALL IN with CRO and made a killing.  Then last night when ALGO spiked to a ridiculously overvalued amount in minutes, I threw a short on that bad boy as fast as I could.  That was the easiest money I ever made.

This morning I woke up excited.  Back in shape, thinking I have this figured out.  Studying history I knew that BTC has to dump at least one more time before we have our epic ride up, and I also know the 20th is historically bad.  I woke up and BTC was down.  The old me would have thought ""THIS IS IT TIME TO GO"" but after all my studying I knew that BTC absolutely HAS to go back deep into the 50's, either $55k or less.  

Don't worry, I fucked up a few times today.  I immediately started to short BTC in the morning, and of course it started gaining.  So I panicked and sold.  And of course it started tanking.  There goes a few hundred bucks.  Then when it was hovering around  $57k I thought ""it'll probably battle here for a bit, this might even be the bottom!"" so I opened a Grid Bot.  It immediately started dipping hard and suddenly hundreds of dollars were vanishing.  I thought, ""Mannnn this might go down to $50k and if I get STUCK there I'm going to be screwed for days...""  so I waited till the price crept up a decent amount more, then closed the bot at a loss.  Sure enough, 5 minutes later, BTC rose enough that I could have broke even.  UGH.  Next thing I see AVAX is oversized compared to BTC, and BTC is flying down again.  So I short AVAX, and again, it stops and reverses.  This time I close my position much sooner because I'm sick of being stupid.

So here's the deal, I'm 100% confident that BTC is heading to $100k, it'll stop at $75k next though and I want to ride BTC up to $75k but wanted a good entry point.  Since BTC was still hovering around $58k for a few hours I realized there's tons of resistance still keeping it ""stable"", so I knew for sure we'd test the lows again.  I set several buy orders staggered downward to $56,500, and just waited patiently.  Meanwhile other coins are (foolishly) making a run for it, and I'm so tempted to switch to them for a few minutes -- but I also knew BTC could flash dump any second now and I'd miss my orders.

The most anxious point was when we finally got back to $57k and I was yet to hit any of my orders.  I was SO TEMPTED to just screw it and ""Market Buy"" here and be done with it.  But I said, ""No way man, you've waited this long.  You made stupid mistakes all day because you were impatient and thought you were clever.  You had a plan, but then thought you were smarter than yourself and YOLO'd in at dumb moments.  HOLD THE FUCKING LINE"".

So I did.  I watched it inch so close to my order, then bounce away.  SOOOOO frustrating.

But at last, down down down it goes, order filled filled filled filled filled.... I can't tell you how happy I am, not just that I achieved my goal but also that I trusted myself and stuck with my original goal.   Yes, I know by the time anyone reads this BTC might be at $52k, and I'm an idiot for not waiting longer -- but here's the thing, I really really don't know if it will get that low.  I was 90% certain it would retest $56500 which is already quite a drop.  Besides, I plan to hang tight for the next few days with what I just grabbed so I'm ok with a little dip on my way up.  It would have been FAR WORSE if I waited for $52k only to see BTC rocket over the next hour up to $70k.  Be bold, be brave, but also be conservative and accept some losses for gauranteed gains.

Thanks for reading, this was a hell of a journey.  I just wanted to share because this 'evolution' goes against the usual sentiment found in this sub, that if you're not holding then you're basically an idiot.  By the way, I don't disagree, unless you have the ability to stare at at chart all day, then this isn't an option.  Thankfully my day job is home based and computer based anyway so I took advantage of the ability to multitask.  So, if you're not in a similar situation then the normal advice really does apply, pick a couple of projects your VERY confident in and just wait.  Rumour has it that XRP is just ripe for an epic pump, sooner than later.

A question to ponder: Has Moon farming ""ruined this sub"" over the past year, or has it simply been the insane explosion of growth we've seen as new crypto people flock here looking for the latest meme pump? I'd wager that any sub on Reddit would see a drop in quality with hundreds of thousands of new users in search of a quick buck. What % of users have even opened their vault? How are Moons the main problem?

Picture your other hobby subreddits outside of crypto. How would people take advantage of a token mechanism to destroy the quality of the sub? Mostly, they wouldn't. r/Cryptocurrency is uniquely positioned to have spam, scams, moonshots, noobs and annoying posts and comments. If social tokens even \*sort of\* work here, they'll for sure work on the New York Giants sub where upvotes are earned through quality commentary on their favorite football team. Those users would be rewarded with a token that could be used to buy tickets, merch, meet-the-team opportunities, or whatever. Apply this concept to your favorite band, sports team, artist, etc.

If you're down on Moons and social tokens as a concept, I'd invite you to listen to any number of recent podcasts featuring Raoul Pal where he talks a lot about how bullish he is on social tokens. The July episode of The Defiant podcast with Raoul as a guest would be a good one. Even if it's imperfect (especially at first), users owning pieces of the communities they're passionate about is worlds better than what we have now. We have to think bigger about what's possible, especially here on Reddit where an NFT platform is being built which you gotta think could be interoperable with community tokens in the future. 

Anyways--just wanna invite everyone to be excited and bullish about social tokens. I believe they'll be one of the next big things in the crypto space and think it's cool that Moons are among the first iterations of what will one day be the norm for online community involvement. 

May we all end up on the moon one way or another.

I hope we could give some of our experiences to the newbies and help each other cope with the dip. One thing that is certain in crypto space is that blue chips always goes back up.

Some of it is pretty funny, but a lot of it is intrinsically linked with rising political disdain of cryptocurrencies. A ton of political commentators regularly follow and comment on their tweets and the account has 250k followers. I’ve seen other accounts too with similar themes. 

Given that we’ve seen many attacks on cryptocurrencies this year through legislation, this trend worries me. If the public starts viewing the entire community as an NFT money laundering, pump-dump scheme filled industry, we’re going to start facing calls for heavy regulation. I kind of agree that a lot of the NFT art / apes stuff is stupid and probably the least valuable use case for NFT technology, but we can’t let that stuff define our community. There’s a lot of great stuff in blockchain, and not everyone is in here for the 100x gains. The technology is revolutionary, and adoption comes with people viewing it favorably, not as a scam.

Micropee needs your help to stop the daily burn, so please invest and grow this little $pee so that we can arrive at the token amount of 100, 000,000 $pee.

I’ve used OKCoin for awhile. Sent a lot of people to them from Reddit for the ability to withdraw on Matic and avax. Benefited from simple promos on near and avax. Everything was going well, they seemed legit. 

But now I’m pissed off.  I did the 100HODL promo where if you set up a recurring buy for 6 months, you get $70. In the rules it says if your purchase gets turned off, you have 30 days to turn it back on.  

Their app was super shitty early this year.  In one of their app updates, my recurring buy got deleted.  I turned it right back on, realized it set the next purchase for a full month later (this couldn’t be modified, app was shit) so I also did an insta buy of same amount to have a buy each month. 

I followed the letter of the rules by turning my buy back on within 30 days, added the extra buy to meet “spirit” of the rules.  

Bonus was due in mid October, not paid. I logged a support case, they assured me it’d be paid but they had a backlog. 

Half dozen such emails over a month, then today I get told they decided I don’t qualify and they’d rather lose a customer than give me $70. The rep even had the balls to suggest I refer more people to get $50 that way. 

So yeah, I won’t be adding any more funds here. I’ll move everything off as soon as my staking times expire.

If you were offered 1 million dollars in cash for your current portfolio — all of it, even the dust, — would you take the deal? But you can't buy crypto in any way until 2022.

Most us probably would, understandably. 

Now let's make the choice a bit harder:

The offer is the same — all your portfolio for 1 million dollars. But this time, somehow, you can't buy any crypto for 10 years (yes, even Monero). 

Now you're thinking...

The ultimate question — you're offered all the same conditions, 1 million dollars, but you have to give crypto for ever — never buy or obtain, directly or through intermediaries, any crypto (yes, MOONs too).

You'd still come across articles about crypto bull runs and dips and crashes, unprecedented all time highs, flippenings, moonshots and all that stuff — you wouldn't look for it, but the way the media is things like that would just pop up. Your friends and family would eventually bring crypto up in conversations with you...

**Tldr: So, would you give up on crypto for life for $1M now?**

PS: Although my portfolio is far from 7 digits, I wouldn't take the the deal for 3 reasons. First, I'm strangely confident my handpicked bags of alts can do better than that in the long run. Second, I wouldn't want to deny myself the possibility to invest into crypto further, even those staking, DEFI lending apys are hard to beat.

There can only be 21 of them and you need to stake possible ten million USD worth of bsc to be one.

We talk a lot about front running transactions. As a validator if you see a bunch of buy transaction coming in for wrapped eth for example on a Dex... You can create a transaction to buy a bunch of the same crypto at the beginning of the block before them. Then put a transaction at the end to sell. You just scalped all their dex swaps.

Seeing how binance just invested 1 billion into developing bnb more... And the CEO is supposedly very very rich (at least tens of billions)... Is it possible their whole ecosystem is rigged to an extent? 

I created tokens on BSC for pancakeswap and that whole ecosystem is kind of a cesspool. And the more I think about it the more I'm convinced BSC is scalping us hard on a lot of these trades. Its not great that bnb has the 3rd biggest mcap and it's probably going to continue to grow with the 1B infusion.

I'd really caution everyone to stick to polygon and other layer2s. Trading shitcoins on bnb legitimately hurts crypto and eventually the whole thing could come crashing down if binance ever gets hounded by regulators. They literally have BSC setup so they aren't liable for the network but can scalp every tx.

exchanges are playing whale games and taking out the over leveraged so they'll be able to pay safe margin traders

this is why crypto leverage is unhealthy for the space but volatility never scared me.

As for the 98k prediction by Plan B, that’s anyones guess. I’ve seen bitcoin do some crazy shit but we are running out of time. I do believe we will see at least 100k by the end of this year.

It is my contention that they are not, and due to the sheer numbers of users on this subreddit, these two groups of investors could be being conflated into one group.

I want to approach this argument from 3 perspectives that match what the OP was taking about.

1. metrics
2. wealth distribution
3. boredom

# Metrics

Firstly, there's let's get something clear about the metrics of this subreddit. This math will use estimates and assumes data provided is correct.

* There are 3.9 million members in this subreddit. 
* The current crypto market cap is around 2,7 trillion USD

*IF* every user was a real account, each person would ONLY have to invest 660 dollars to fund this marketcap.

As we know, usually this is not the case in investing, it follows a distribution model where you have whales, and you have small fish. So for every one user that has $100,000 invested, how many do you think invested $10,000? $100? $10? 

There is no way for me to calculate this, using wallet addresses would not be enough. On a side note, this is why you should never take financial advice from random shitposters. Maybe you want to YOLO $1000 and they risked $10 dollars, at a different buy price than you.

# Wealth distribution

A lot of people are ""only"" investing 10 dollars because they. are. poor.

I do **not** mean to disparage you. I am **not** making fun of you. It is hard to imagine for those living under stable financial conditions what it might be like living paycheque to paycheque. This thinking also applies richer investors, who understand that the system we are living in has conditioned us that money is the critical metric of success. 

Without getting too political, also I think we can agree that this current FIAT system keeps us down with inflation, taxation and various financial fuckery done by governments and banking.

So, why do they check the charts? Why try to squeeze every penny of gains out of potential buys and sells? Why risk leverage, margin, loans, on such a volatile asset that is a ""sure thing"" in the future. 

There are 2 aspects to this thinking : trying to time the market, and spending time in the market. 

Allow me to elaborate on this logic: IF you time it right, and buy the bottom, your returns will be greater IF you spend the appropriate amount of time in the market. 

Both of these are **unknowns**, and looking back on it I'm pretty shit with my buy prices. However, we can confidently say that even if you DON'T time the market, if you spend enough time IN the market, you will make gains. So yeah, chill out and hodl.

# Boredom

The last part of OPs post is definitely solid advice. Checking those charts and doing nothing else in your life will eventually erode your mental and physical stamina, and can lead to anxiety and breakdowns. 

You certainly don't want to be the guy at a family outing shouting at his phone like a degenerate gambler shouting at the horse that didn't win. 

A lot of I'm sure ""working from home"" or unemployment has contributed to sitting on your ass waiting to get rich. But i'm here to tell you being consumed by it is not healthy for you, and that's medical advice.

Try shitposting in the daily some more, have some fun and loosen up. As per the TOS and rules of the subreddit it's not supposed to be financial advice so I don't get why a lot of you treat it that way. People like to complain about adding financial rewards to karma has ruined the subreddit, but i think taking the memes out also did it's damage.

**All charts and no play makes Jack a dull boy.**

**tldr**; it is my reasoning that people check charts because of the amount of money they have invested, the potential financial freedom they seek from maximizing gains and boredom. The idea is not mutually exclusive because these people could belong to multiple categories or just one, we don't have a good way of verifying that."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3933244|public|self|"Thesis: Why people ""check the charts 100 times per day"" even though they're in it for ""the long run"""|2|[]|0.82|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qx1m2k/thesis_why_people_check_the_charts_100_times_per/|all_ads|6|1637255418.0||||||||||||2021-11-18 22:40:18+00:00|t3_qx1m2k|0|25||

Did I miss any red-flags? Am I just paranoid from looking at crypto too long?

&amp;#x200B;

This is definitely not me shilling anything. In fact, it's probably the opposite. I read a commentary article on some news site I visit that was all about how blockchain could be the solution to ransomware problems. The article is here for reference. [https://federalnewsnetwork.com/commentary/2021/11/dont-make-ransomware-harder-for-cybercriminals-make-it-impossible/](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/commentary/2021/11/dont-make-ransomware-harder-for-cybercriminals-make-it-impossible/)

It calls for a next-gen blockchain with ""unlimited scalability, exceptional security and inherent flexibility"" to solve the issue. Ok, my BS-detectors are going off. What's going on here? Next the author goes on to explain how TPS is to blockchains what bandwidth is to internet. I don't particularly like this comparison because a blockchain requires a network connection which would also be restrained by bandwidth. And a ""transaction"" could be a few Kb or a few Gb depending on what the blockchain is doing and what you consider a usable transaction. He talks about how streaming wasn't usable on 56k modems but are now that bandwidth has increased so much. I think a lot of blockchains could be infinitely scalable if resources are also infinitely scalable. But ok, maybe he's boiling it down in simpler terms to reach a broader / newer audience. I can get past the comparison but he's counting on tech leaps that haven't happened yet. Or have they...

Then he uses the term ""military-grade encryption"". The military has to use FIPS 140 compliant encryption. FIPS compliant encryption doesn't mean it's the most secure encryption out there. It means it's the most secure encryption that has been approved. I wouldn't call their approval process simple so I have to believe this lags behind industry quite a bit. But again, maybe he's just appealing to the federal community he's writing to. 

Once you finish the article, you see it's written by the founder and CEO of Upheaval LLC. Oh look at that, they're a company who claims to have blockchain solutions. But the author doesn't mention them in the article or make any claims as to what their company can do to fix it. Maybe they didn't want to buy ad space. So dude writes a ""There has to be a better way..."" article prophesizing about how some magical blockchain could solve all these problems. Then you look up his company and they're claiming to have all these solutions. 

I've never heard of the company or their solutions before. So I wanted to check here because if there's one place I can count on to poke holes in something, it's reddit. If you go to their website, you get to meet their leaders and can learn more about investing. But there's no white paper. Nothing to tell me anything about the technology. Just that they're the only ""multi-dimensional blockchain platform"". OooooOOOoOoooOoo. I hope they use the Hypnofrog Consensus mechanism."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3932314|public|self|Any community info on Ironweave or Upheaval?|0|[]|0.56|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qwy65u/any_community_info_on_ironweave_or_upheaval/|all_ads|6|1637245765.0|||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'zkIT9fLTmJ8BZ90GADT3t3bUDMb_2W3l02faQpX6KV0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 83, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fMa22ysCC0sZpuGMoxmFK8dA_eteDu-Qa7-2gfPgEPE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7611418b1d973c1a404cd8c64fd116db9c1507af', 'width': 108}, {'height': 167, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fMa22ysCC0sZpuGMoxmFK8dA_eteDu-Qa7-2gfPgEPE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f4690f4f5230681c99cb9c687e9091ac7311a9b', 'width': 216}, {'height': 248, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fMa22ysCC0sZpuGMoxmFK8dA_eteDu-Qa7-2gfPgEPE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2fc4229fdb6472a8d4db694f0b16b641533b76f', 'width': 320}, {'height': 497, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fMa22ysCC0sZpuGMoxmFK8dA_eteDu-Qa7-2gfPgEPE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81a7c3c5b54f774b14eaa1fb5b0f4aacc7f3e156', 'width': 640}, {'height': 746, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fMa22ysCC0sZpuGMoxmFK8dA_eteDu-Qa7-2gfPgEPE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f258bc9191866edbda311b2b2f6e57fddd6d10e5', 'width': 960}, {'height': 839, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fMa22ysCC0sZpuGMoxmFK8dA_eteDu-Qa7-2gfPgEPE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718b561ab62877c5961219d1e947afd167d44dd1', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 933, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/fMa22ysCC0sZpuGMoxmFK8dA_eteDu-Qa7-2gfPgEPE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=62980f4b96bd75c05596fd497aa426294eb91bb5', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}||||||||2021-11-18 19:59:25+00:00|t3_qwy65u|0|1||
