- bllock propagation

- bllock validation. 


Bllock propagation matters for miners behind their full nodes.

Bllock validation matters for full nodes that don't mine. 

Bigg bllocks messing up block propagation will lead to miners risking other miners finding the next block before 51% of the network has seen there block. This would mean their orphan rates go up and they start losing money. Then miners will group together and centralise to protect themselves against losses which would mean Bitcoin start losing decentralisation. 

Messing up block validation means that your nodes stop syncing as new blocks arrive faster then your node can verify if all the rules are being followed. This then means you start depending on other people their nodes and will make it so that only the people will the most expensive computers can run a full node.

However keep in mind that Bitcoin from the very beginning was designed to run as a layered system.

Full mining nodes at the top

then full nodes that don't mine


Then Simpleton Payment Verification servers that plug in to full nodes.

The designer designed it this way because according to him (bitcorntalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306)

&gt;The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.


So that means we have to solve three problems.

Bllock propagation, block validation and SPVV traffic. 

Let's solve them! 


First bllock propagation.  A block contains transactions that a miner has collected in his mempool. But there are more mempools. All miners run one and full nodes that don't mine also run one. The transactions that arrive in one mempool get copied constantly to all the other mempools. That means at any given time about 99% of the transactions in the mempools are duplicates.

So when a miner finds a block rather then putting all these in a block and sending the transactions that other miners already have in their mempool. A miner can also do a quick exchange with these mempools and figure out what information is missing and then only send the missing information. The mempools of the other miners can then just reconstruct the block, rather then having to download the entire blocks. 


This idea is called  [Pencill]

people.cs.umass.edu/~gbiss/pencill.pdf should mostly solve the issue.  With Pencill, a typical 1 GB block can be encoded in about 20 kB, most of which is order information. With a canonical ordering, that number should drop to about 5 kB. Sending 20 kB or 5 kB over the internet is pretty trivial, and should add about 1 second total.

After that, UDP+FEC should get us to the point where we can forget about block prop issues for a long time.

Second SPVV traffic. 


SPVV traffic is pretty easy to serve from a few high-performance nodes in datacenters. You might be thinking of JL article a year back. He assumed that each SPVV request requires reading the full block from disk just for that one request, and that's not at all true on a protocol level, although it currently is true on the implementation level. You can have different nodes that keep different blocks in RAM, and shard your SPVV requests out among different nodes based on which blocks they have cached. These nodes can also condense several different SPVV requests into a single bloom filter, and use that one bloom filter to check the block for relevant transactions for 100 or 1000 SPV requests all at the same time. It's really not going to be that hard to scale that part. Home users' full nodes can simply elect not to serve SPVV, and leave that part to businesses and miners. We professionals can handle the problem efficiently enough that the costs won't be significant, just as the costs per user aren't significant now.


Third, block sorting. A 1 GB bllock would have about 2.5 million transactions. Assuming that we're using a canonical lexical ordering, we will need to sort the txids for those transactions. Single-threaded sorting is typically between 1 million keys per second and (for uint64_t keys) 10 million keys per second, so sorting should take around 1 second.

Fourth, computing and verifying the merkle root hash. The amount of hashing needed to do this is equal to 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + ... = 2 times the summed length of the txids, multiplied by two because we do two rounds of SHA256. With 2.5 million transactions, that's 320 MB of hashing. SHA256 can do around 300 MB/s on a single core, so this will take about 1 second.

Fifth, bllock validation. This step is hard to estimate, because we don't have any good benchmarks for how an ideal implementation would perform, nor do we even have a good idea of what the ideal implementation would look like. Does the node have the full UTXO set in RAM, or does it need to do SSD reads? Are we going to shard the UTXO set by txid across multiple nodes? Are we using flash or Optane for the SSD reads and writes? But you said napkin, so here's a shot. A 1 GB block is likely to have around 5 million inputs and 5 million outputs. Database reads can be done as a single disk IO op pretty easily, but writes generally have to be done more carefully, with separate writes to the journal, and then to multiple levels of the database tree structure. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that each database write consists of four disk writes plus one disk read, or 5 ops total. This means that a 1 GB block will require around 10 million reads and 20 million writes. Current-gen m.2 PCIE NVMe top-of-the-line SSDs can get up to 500k IOPS. In two years, a good (but not top-end) SSD will probably be getting around 1 million random IOPS in both reads and writes. This would put the disk accesses at around 30 seconds of delay. Sharding the database onto multiple SSDs or multiple nodes can reduce that, but I presume desktop computers won't have access to that. If we have Optane, the UTXO stuff should get way faster (10x? 50x?), as Optane has byte-level addressability for both reads and writes, so we will no longer need to read and write 4 kB blocks for each 30 byte UTXO. Optane also has much better latency, so a good database will be able to get lower write amplification without needing to worry about corruption.

Zeroth, script verification. This is generally done when a transaction hits mempool, and those validation results are cached for later use, so no substantial extra script verification should need to be done during block validation. All we need is to make sure AcceptToMemoryPool doesn't get bogged down in the 10 minutes before the block. A single CPU core can verify about 5000 p2pkh scripts (i.e. single ECDSA sigop) per second, so an 8-core desktop should be able to handle 40,000 p2pkh inputs per second. Verifying the 5 million inputs in advance should take 125 seconds out of our 600 second window. That's cutting our safety margins a bit close, but it's tolerable for a non-mission-critical min-spec machine. Because this is done in advance, that 125/600 seconds turns into 0 seconds for the sake of this calculation.

All told, we have about (1 + 10 + 1 + 0.5 + 30) = 42.5 seconds for a decent desktop to receive and verify a 1 GB block, assuming that all the code bottlenecks get fixed. There are probably a few other steps that I didn't think of, so maybe 60 seconds is a more fair estimate. Still, it's reasonable. It means on average every time minute a 1000 dollar modern desktop computer is given 10% of the time between blocks to validate them. 

Miners will, of course, need to be able to receive and process blocks much faster than this, but they will have the funding to buy computers with much greater parallelization, so their safety margin versus what they can afford should be about the same as for a casual desktop user.

Now let's talk about upstream bandwidth.  How much upload bandwith would be required just to relay transactions to a few peers?

This largely depends on how many peers that our user has. Let's assume that our desktop user is a middle-class hobbyist, and is only sacrificing peer count a little bit in favor of reduced hardware requirements. Our user has 8 peers.

Transaction propagation comes from 3 different p2p messages.

The first message is the INV message, which is used to announce that a node knows one or more transactions with a specified TXID or TXIDs. These INV messages are usually batched into groups of 3 or so right now, but in a higher-throughput context, would likely be batched in groups of 20. The TCP/IP and other overhead is significant, so an INV for a single TXID is around 120 bytes, and each additional TXID adds around 40 bytes (not the 32 byte theoretical minimum). With 20 tx per inv, that's 880 bytes. For each peer connection, half of the transactions will be part of a received INV, and half will be part of a sent INV. This means that per 2.5 million transactions (i.e. one block) per peer, our node would send and receive 55 MB. For all 8 peers, that would be 440 MB in each direction for INVs.

The second and third messages are the tx request and the tx response. With overhead, these two messages should take around 600 bytes for a 400 byte transaction. If our node downloads each transaction once and uploads once, that turns into 1.5 GB of traffic in each direction per block.

Lastly, we need to propagate the blocks themselves. With Graphene, the traffic needed for this step is trivial, so we can ignore it.

In total, we have about 1.94 GB bidirectional of traffic during each (average) 600 second block interval. That translates to average bandwidth of 3.23 MB/s or 25.9 Mbps. This is, again, reasonable to expect for a motivated middle-class hobbyist around 2020, though not trivial.


Now let's talk about full nodes at your home connection and full nodes in a data centre.

You might think those at the data centre are much easier to censor but you would be wrong.

Your home connection comes with many agreements, often with one that forbids you from running a server.  The rights and enforcements of those rights is a lot harder for a home consumer then a company with lawyers that entered in to a  SLA.

Therefore it would be much easier for your ISP to start filtering our your full node traffic then for an internet exchange where your company is directly plugged in to a backbone and has entered in to peering agreements. 


And finally we have to realize that once you have enough full nodes, getting twice as much full nodes does not make the network twice as decentralized.

Satoshi calculated that a 100 000 global full nodes would be enough to be decentralised and that more does not make it more decentralized.


Also slower nodes run by hobbyist that don't get paid to run them and don't have a business that depends on them running properly slow down the rest of the network.

JL  hasl already experienced that(

blog.jl.net/2021-bitcoin-node-performance-tests-2

There is less Bitcoin traffic then in 2017 yet nodes sync 25% slower because there are less nodes run by businesses and more nodes run by hobbyists that have no financial incentives to care about their nodes. 


All of this means that the way to scale Bitcoin and remain decentralised is

- good old software engineering

- adoption as money so that big retailers and tens of thousands of businesses have to run full nodes to serve their customers or lose compared to their competitors that already run them. 


What happens when we don't do this?

Block reward runs out (only 2 million BTC left) and to maintain current security levels which cost 50 million dollars worth of electricity a day you would have to divide 50 million dollars by 200 000 tx a day which is 250 dollars per transaction. Or the price of Bitcoin would keep doubling every having which does not seem to be the case as the liquidity now vs in 2017 has only grown by about 55% and not a 100%.  It's also not long term sustainable. It would mean a market cap of 27 trillion dollars in 24 years while still only having a 100 000 users that make transactions."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4409102|public|self|||Here is how Ethereum COULD scale without increasing centralisation and without depending on layer two's.|1|[]|0.43|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/se5yb5/here_is_how_ethereum_could_scale_without/||all_ads|6|1643290612.0|||||||||||2022-01-27 19:06:52+00:00|t3_se5yb5|0|0||

Tomorrow Astroswap will go live . In a recent VC on the official TG group , they claimed that the user  experience their Dex will be far much smoother than the existing Native Dexs on ADA . 

  
They  explained that this will be achieved by launching the Dex on the Velas Main net and then bridged to the Cardano ecosystem via the Swapz bridging protocol and i guess they will be using the NAMI wallet for transactions. 

They stated that this was more like a layer 2 solution just like Polygon matic is to ETH . We will get to know how effective this is going to be under 24 hours now so i am excited and curious !

I did grasp the idea , but how exactly will this possible ,is something beyond my grey matter's pay grade ,if someone know how this is done and if it can explained in a simplified manner , i would love to hear your thoughts !

Hope it's not a stupid question. So let's say my dogelon skyrockets due to a tweet or something. It's suddenly at $1 (I know, don't even... I know) and all of a sudden I (and many others) are multimillionnaires. Or, if one wants to be a bit more realisitic, I got in on an alt at the right time, it goes moonward and if I sell my assets in the next 30 minutes before the crash I'm going to make a lot of money. How do I best do this? Would you transfer your coins to something stable like Tether, then cash out now your money is in a safer place? If a fairly well known coin went nuclear could exchanges like Coinbase do a Robin Hood and just put a temporary hold on all withdrawals? And how would you make the most of your money? Are there companies that already back loans with Crypo at stake, or would it be more sensible to just cash everything out, pay your taxes, and get a very good accountant?|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4409177|public|self|||What to do if you want to sell your coins very quickly?|0|[]|0.75|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/se6cnp/what_to_do_if_you_want_to_sell_your_coins_very/||all_ads|6|1643291636.0|new||||||||||2022-01-27 19:23:56+00:00|t3_se6cnp|0|12||

Entrepreneurs do not typically brag about their criminal records when  promoting a new business venture. But Peter Levashov, one of Russia’s  most notorious hackers, believes his rap sheet may help attract  investors.

“The U.S. government gave me lemons,”  he tells TIME in his first interview about his long career as a  cybercriminal, referring to his 2018 [guilty plea](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ct/page/file/1120596/download) in connection with a handful of felonies, including wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. “I’m selling the lemonade.”

Levashov was one of the most famous cybercriminals  caught in the U.S. government’s dragnet to arrest and extradite Russian  hackers in the wake of the attacks targeting the 2016 presidential  election. His arrest in April 2017, while on holiday in Spain, set off a  legal battle over his extradition that lasted nearly a year. Levashov  claimed at the time that U.S. authorities wanted him in connection with  the Russian election hacks. He also said he had worked as a hacker for  United Russia, the ruling political party of President Vladimir Putin.

In  July, a federal judge sentenced Levashov to time served, plus three  years of supervised release. Since then, Levashov has been working on a  new venture, which he calls [SeveraDAO](https://severadao.ai/). Its goal, he says, is to crack one of the most elusive puzzles of the information age: teaching machines how to pick stocks.

“My  competitor is BlackRock,” he says, casually gunning for the world’s  largest asset manager. If he can attract enough capital, Levashov also  has plans to create his own cryptocurrency, his own cybersecurity  company and, as he writes to would-be investors in a summary of the  project published online this month, “anything you wish.”

The  four-page pitch is remarkably open about the criminal history that  earned Levashov such nicknames as “the spam king” and “the bot master.”

“I  started by doing many illegal things, like hacking computers and  systems,” he writes in the project’s white paper. “I learned many things  through my mistakes and I am deeply sorry for what I did when I was  young.”

Levashov, 41, was a teenager when he  began learning how to build viruses. He went on to assemble what would  become one of the largest networks of infected computers in history.  Known as a botnet, it included tens of thousands of computers around the  world that Levashov could control from his home in St. Petersburg  without the owners even knowing it. At its peak, the botnet used these  computers to pump out more than a billion spam emails a day, according  to U.S. investigators, including messages that spread ransomware or  other malicious programs that could seize the data of infected  computers.

### More from TIME



After his arrest, Levashov  reportedly told a Spanish court that he had worked for Putin’s party. “I  collected different information about opposition parties and delivered  it to the necessary people at the necessary time,” he reportedly said.  “If I go to the U.S., I will die in a year,” he [said at the time](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-botnet/russian-hacker-wanted-by-u-s-tells-court-he-worked-for-putins-party-idUSKCN1C32EP),  according to the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, which closely  followed his case in Madrid. “I will be tortured, within a year I will  be killed, or I will kill myself.”

Asked about  these statements by TIME, Levashov says they were part of a strategy to  win sympathy from the Spanish judge and to make the U.S. charges against  him seem political in nature. “That was all a big lie,” he says in an  interview in New Haven, Conn., where he now lives. “I never worked for  Putin or anything like that.”

Indeed,  the indictment against Levashov makes no mention of Russian election  interference, focusing instead on his control of the botnet known as  Kelihos, which was [allegedly used](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ct/us-v-peter-levashov)  for pump-and-dump stock market manipulations and other illegal schemes.  “No cyber criminal should rest easy,” Brian Turner, the special agent  in charge of the FBI’s New Haven division, [said in announcing](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-who-operated-kelihos-botnet-pleads-guilty-fraud-conspiracy-computer-crime?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery) Levashov’s guilty plea. Prosecutors asked the court to send Levashov to prison for at least 12 years.

But  in July, Judge Robert Chatigny sentenced Levashov to the 33 months he  had already served in jail, plus three years of supervised release.  “Thirty-three months is a long time and I’m sure it was especially  difficult for you considering you were away from your wife and child,  away from home,” the judge [said](https://www.courthousenews.com/federal-judge-sentences-russian-spammer-to-time-served/).  The court has not yet ruled on whether to impose a fine or restitution  payments on Levashov, whose deportation from the U.S. has been deferred  at least until April.

Reflecting on his case,  Levashov says his biggest mistake was to fight the U.S. request for his  extradition. That decision cost him nearly a year of his life as his  case worked its way through Spanish courts. For a time he was held in  the same Madrid cell block as another Russian hacker, Stanislav Lisov,  who had also been arrested on a U.S. warrant in early 2017. Though Lisov  pleaded guilty to stealing more than $800,000 from accounts in U.S.  banks, he [also received a sentence](https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-deports-russian-hacker-convicted-of-stealing-almost-1-million/30675437.html) far below the legal maximum; he was deported back to Russia in June 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

While  awaiting his own deportation, Levashov plans to stay in New Haven and  develop his business project. The venture will be structured as a  Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, which has lately [become a trend](https://fortune.com/2021/11/19/dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization-consitutiondao/)  among crypto investors and enthusiasts. It allows people to pool their  money, usually in cryptocurrency, and pursue projects as an online  collective. One such group, called PleasrDAO, [made headlines](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/arts/music/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html)  in October with the $4 million purchase of the sole existing copy of an  album by the Wu-Tang Clan, which had previously been owned by disgraced  pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli.

Levashov  has more ambitious goals for his collective, which is named after an  alias (Severa) he used during his criminal career. Using his experience  with botnets, he wants to teach a “trading bot” to analyze the language  in stock market news and “quickly turn market sentiment into profit,”  according to his white paper."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4409189|public|self|||This Infamous Russian Hacker Wants Your Crypto Investment|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/se6i4v/this_infamous_russian_hacker_wants_your_crypto/||all_ads|6|1643292024.0|new||||||||||2022-01-27 19:30:24+00:00|t3_se6i4v|0|2||

I want to see it grow and I want to see it troubleshoot past it’s barriers. It’s gonna be a tough ride but I think the outcome will be worth it. 

Acceptances:

\- There was always the realization that government regulation was going to be an eventuality.

\- The energy consumption issue is real and we are waiting for a ""hail Mary"" in renewable energy to negate the power consumption of mining... but maybe that's incentive for mining centers that use renewable energy. ""Mining tourism,"" if you will, for the regions in the world that are well suited for the task.

\- The 2000 tech bubble is the trajectory being prophesied: Everyone went all in on silicone valley too fast too soon because the potential for every project was based on promises of potential not results. It did take about 4/5 years for things to come together. We're trying to build a new way of transacting on so many different levels... this is going to take some time.

Users must identify their transactions from CEX and tie their wallet addresses with their KYC.

When you use Trezor, it automatically tracks your private wallets and obtains evidence to that effect. Trezor claim this is a regulatory requirement under Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority's crypto AML rules. 

**But no one asked Trezor to implement these things at a personal wallet level**. Travel rule requirements exist for exchanges and they report it to the government. Nobody has asked wallet companies to bring this nonsense to private wallets. The country regulators havent asked Trezor to do this, literally no one has asked them to.

This is how these features look like now:

[Sign proof of your address](https://preview.redd.it/r50sczvv5de81.jpg?width=2880&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a88accc2f451aa473ae32e2b57762923251a430b)

By implementing such bullshit features, wallet providers are giving more authority to big governments to come after our privacy. Bending to the whims of just one country ...This is absolutely disgusting by Trezor. **They are trying to become leaders in crypto surveillance when there is absolutely no one asking them to do so, no regulator has asked hardware wallets to track user wallets KYC.**

This is what Trezor is claiming: 

[Users have to pro-actively share the information \(that is already known as they are KYC'd\) themselves and sign the message. The information has to match the KYC details that were already shared by the user with the exchange during the KYC process.](https://preview.redd.it/niuuns5k6de81.jpg?width=1336&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c78ee76da69488d7547395ee72db0536fb53f0b4)

It’s nothing serious, just something for people from our school to trade around and have fun with. We were also thinking of making it a competition tied to betting on our school football games but that’s besides the point. 

The token is created and I’m at the part where I’m supposed to add initial liquidity to pancake swap. I understand that this determines the initial price. 

The thing is, this all seems very arbitrary to me and I was wondering, what’s a good initial price for a token to be? So like, 1 BNB should be worth how much? I really don’t know what to base this on because you could make it worth anything. My other question was what’s a good initial liquidity for a new token to have? I don’t have a lot of money and like I said, this is mostly just for fun. 

I don’t want to run into a problem where I do this wrong and the token runs out or something in case we do end up using this for betting. I think it would be really fun to have a competition where the winners receive tokens and people can bet a certain amount etc, but I just don’t want this all to blow up."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4411089|public|self|||Adding initial liquidity|0|[]|0.73|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sehg0f/adding_initial_liquidity/||all_ads|6|1643322195.0|new||||||||||2022-01-28 03:53:15+00:00|t3_sehg0f|0|5||

So I am struggling to decide about this tiny project if it's a scam, legit, or legit but no future.

I have 90% of my crypto in stable projects, but I love hunting small early-stage ones, to find gems. (Like i did more than a year ago with Chromia and did a nice 20x), because often worth it.  


So I invested a tiny amount in this one as it sounds good, and they also have more than nothing...  


The token is Engine token and the team working on releasing a game/protocol(?), bit cloudy for me.  
They shared some screenshots of the game which made me really hyped (finally someone with a working product!!) so I put some money in it, but then when I finally got the chance to try, I figured it's just a ""mini"" game, made on CORE and there are literally hundreds of them there. They say their environment is different and they will implement a blockchain under it. Anyway, I don't know what to think anymore, so I throw it to you guys to disassemble and tell the harsh or nice truth what you think about them.

&amp;#x200B;

If we found an early gem welcome, if it's a scam then please don't hold back, let others know.  
They have a telegram channel, but its worthless, its just people repeating ""PUMP"" and the answers are the same if you try to ask anything (ITS THE FUTURE, IT WILL BE HUGE, IT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING)  


*(I also managed to find some of the founders online, but that's also borderline-stalking so I won't share, just saying...you can. But nothing special about them, their Facebook is full of stupid memes.)*

**Crypto exchange Binance has partnered with Paysafe to allow EUR deposits and withdrawals via the SEPA payment network. “The full re-opening of SEPA channels will scale up across the markets in due course,” Binance noted.**  


## Binance Resuming SEPA Transfers in Phases

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced Wednesday that it has “reopened EUR bank transfer by SEPA.” The company explained:

&gt;**Binance has partnered with Paysafe to launch the pilot program for EUR deposit and withdrawal via the SEPA payment network, effective 2022-01-26 13:00 (UTC).**

“Users are selected based on a range of testing criteria to participate in the pilot program,” Binance added. “The full re-opening of SEPA channels will scale up across the markets in due course.”

A person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that the rollout will begin in Belgium and Bulgaria, and could potentially be extended to other uses in the weeks ahead. Binance suspended transfers via the single euro payments area (SEPA) in June last year.

The cryptocurrency exchange has been facing scrutiny in a number of jurisdictions worldwide, including Pakistan , Canada , the U.S., U.K., South Africa, Australia, Norway, Netherlands, Hong Kong, Germany, Italy, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Turkey, and Lithuania.

In August, Binance said it is making regulatory compliance a top priority. The company is moving from a decentralized business model to a centralized one, as it pivots from a technology company to a financial services company.

Earlier this month, Binance partnered with a Thai company to launch a cryptocurrency exchange in Thailand. Binance also received in-principle approval from the central bank of Bahrain in December to operate a cryptocurrency service provider in the country."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4412524|public|self|||Binance Begins Allowing EUR Deposits and Withdrawals via SEPA Payment Network|0|[]|1.0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sepezi/binance_begins_allowing_eur_deposits_and/||all_ads|6|1643352125.0|new||||||||||2022-01-28 12:12:05+00:00|t3_sepezi|0|1||

These cryptos, instead of bringing new technology and novel concepts, fail to meet the industry's challenge. I believe in addition to this the cannabis cryptocurrencies fall short owing to their lack of technological innovation and the fact that they are tied to a certain industry, restricting their potential market reach. To be accepted by the communities, a currency must be broadly acknowledged and have desired DeFi needs.   

I understand the need for DeFi solutions for everything, but why hasn't the market for cannabis and CBD products been included in this system? The Tangi Token whitepaper, which recently completed its first pre-sale, further piqued my interest. On their route map, I'm sure they've located the answer. Tangi Token is the answer the cannabis industry has been waiting for. Using their services would be beneficial to both the user and the marijuana dispensary.

And in their statement, they clearly stated their ambition on Metaverse.  

&gt; “Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO, Microsoft 

Even if you are not familiar with gaming and all, you probably heard [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/), a massive MMORPG game and it's created by Blizzard - so technically it's now Microsoft's game. Along with other big games. Currently, it's stated in EULA that you can't involve any real money in WoW items

&gt; **You are not allowed to buy or sell WoW items, products, or services for real money**. Accounts involved in real money transactions may be penalized under our End User License Agreement. 

But I have a feeling that WoW would be the best and biggest move in the Metaverse race. I know, many of you, including me, is completely against big corporates trying to take over the free nature of the crypto market but someone needs to start from somewhere, otherwise, regular users won't become a reality. Facebook did a bold thing by renaming itself as Meta, but overall, Microsoft going into this business would be ten times better than Meta. Because I think their ""tech-aware"" user volume is way bigger than Meta at the moment. Microsoft is already trying different things such as the ""rewards"" program for their Edge browser which awards you money.  They also have millions of users on their cloud system such as Game-pass that requires money transactions. They also have Xbox, and out-of-the-race VR headset. When all these things combined, it's definitely a bigger player. Think about the scenario where they create Edgecoin or something similar - which you can buy/trade items in WoW, or buy monthly game-pass, games on Xbox and so on. I think this would boost Cryptomarket value immersively. And it would be a great gateway for those who don't understand much about crypto - so that they would be in system as well and can divert their resources to more decentralized solutions.

I want to know what you guys all think about this. Do you think it would be helpful or harmful?"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|4409266|public|self|||Microsoft's take on Metaverse - What do you think they have in mind?|0|[]|0.72|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/se6xry/microsofts_take_on_metaverse_what_do_you_think/||all_ads|6|1643293182.0|||||||||||2022-01-27 19:49:42+00:00|t3_se6xry|0|9||

I joined Reddit for all reasons crypto to help me since I started buying it. I actually bought some XRP I still have back in 2018 and nothing until CRO Oct 2021. 

I am buying crypto for the long haul and will diversify more at some point. Another retirement fund for me. 

This subreddit has a whole heck of lot to read as far as rules, what it is/has etc. A LOT! Not a bad thing tho. 

As far as moons. I don't really yet understand (I have like 5 somehow?) them, but see you can use them for membership here or get Reddit coins. 

Is this page membership able to be paid for cash and yearly as opposed to monthly or whatever with 1000 moons. Ill never achieve 1000 moons. Dont even know how I have 5? 

Also is it worth getting the membership here and how about Reddit Premium? Should I upgrade to that? I have only seen some random comments of people clowning those that pay for Reddit. 

I bought some coins 2 times to give a few awards just for the hell of it. I never got an award and dont really understand those fully. Tho I did give em. Lol

I see there's two popular ones... ledger and trezor. One of my main concerns is I run Linux, suse to be exact, and don't generally use windows. They both seem to support linux but I'm asking for the experience of others here which one works best for linux users? I also use Android if that matters...I say this because I see ledger has a Bluetooth model not sure if that's worth it or not. The coins I hold are bitcoin, eth and a few ada.

I think it is time people start using what brain power they have left and start questioning how a company such as Tether is allowed to print unbacked money as it hands that fake liquidity over to its closest partners the exchange as in Bitfinex and the rest of them..

Stable coins are the problem and the fraud that run this market.. You have private entities selling consumers unbacked versions of a dollar which at ANY moment can loose their peg to it; While they literally work side by side some of the largest exchanges out there..

Between the wash trading that they take part in, the stop hunts and every possible angle they take at squeezing the most real world liquidity out of people for actual currencies; The largest money laundering fraud is taking part right under out noses while the regulators sit back and do absolutely nothing about it...

The majority of this market is a complete sham and has been volume that was washed in via stable coins that have nothing to back them... Fake volume was and is constantly being generated which draws in retail and ultimately provides the real cash these thieves are after.... When questioning them about how they are allowed to operate so suspiciously they just take the ignore that person route, versus giving them piece of mind in what is a multi trillion dollar industry being controlled by a few small players....

Tethers own website states that the peg may not remain and therefor the entire market is vulnerable to a complete collapse once these groups decide to exit on the investors before them... Crypto is only worth the TETHERS stated in the charts; Not the dollars seeing as there are no real dollars to back those charts up!!!

Put some pressure on the regulators.. Put some pressure on the companies like Tether and Bitfiniex.. Stop allowing thieves to operate unhinged with no consequences. The more people that stand up to this scam, the more people who stop taking part in crypto until it is regulated and sold in ACTUAL REAL WORLD CURRENCY the better it will be for this industry as a whole... Until then the majority of this volume in this market is not even real money and has been placed there by fraudulent third parties who are being allowed to get away with it year after year.!
