Let's talk about the results and the new purchases!

First, let's see our profits or losses from worst to best! Each one had initially $1000 invested in them.

Coin Short | Profit/loss
-|-|-
BTRS |  -$134.33 
YUSRA | -$101.70 
ERG |  -$4.89 
COVER | +$85.92 
AUTO | +$112.48
ADK | +$136.90
ANY | +$274.49
BONDLY | +$307.01
FIO | +$348.09
QQQ | +$352.81
Total profit | $1376.78
Total to spend | $11376.78

3 coins made me a loss, with ERG only a tiny loss. 7 coins made me a profit, with 6 of them making a bigger profit than the biggest loss that was made. A total of 1376 profit was made which leaves me with over 11k to spend on this round! 

Some extra info: While those 10 coins made me a profit, the overal performance has been horrible. With the best coin being around the 330 rank last time, now the best one is at rank 433.  Four of the investments fell out of the top 500, and only one of those made me a loss. Many coins performed a whole lot better!

Now, let's name the next list of shitcoins! From the worst performer to the best worst performer. From almost 50% down to only about 17% down. Each coin getting $1137.68 of investment.

Coin Short | Amount bought
- | -
XEM | 2917.13
REV | 7584.53
MXX | 3346.18
MASK | 92.49
XLT | 446.15
EGG | 17.56
ZKS | 476.02 
BRG | 4550.72
XWC | 568.84
BMI | 419.49

Fewer from the top 400-500 this time, only 4 while it was 6/7 last time. And this time the worst entry is a top 100 coin! There's also far more small value coins with 4 being under $1, while last time that was only 1.

When you look up info about how to spot a scam coin, one of the things it tells you to look out for is...

###Signs of a scam coin

1. **""Unknown Group of Entrepreneurs are Running it""**

The Federal Reserve is run by a group of ""Unknown Private Investors""

2. **Whois lookup on one of their websites comes back anonymous or unavailable.**

WHOIS look up for UsMint .gov  tells me
""Information not available or no support for .gov""

3. **Shilling you to believe it's real by offering multiple periodic Airdrops**.

We're on our 3rd Stimulus now?

4. **Confusing whitepaper thats overwritten, and difficult to understand**

Anyone ever try to read, and understand Federal Reserve banking laws, or policies?
Some things can be understood but usually it's written almost entirely in Dog Latin, and you're going to need a lawyer to interpret that just like you'll need a fraud lawyer with crypto experience to go over that whitepaper when you're going after that scam coin to get your money back.  It's also INSANELY OVERWRITTEN.  The USD white paper will literally take you months to go over and understand. 

5. **GitHub Source has no supply limit set**(Devs can Mint coins)

Ahhh.... Nah, those private investors I don't know wouldn't want to do that. Besides, that would devalue the dollar, and severely hurt their credibility.

There is no tax obligation when you use your crypto's value this way - turns out if you never *sell* crypto, you don't owe taxes on it.

If you take out fully-secured loans against the value of your crypto (using it as 'digital asset collateral' - google it!), you owe no taxes on that money, and you have the right to come back for more cash (or to withdraw some of your crypto) if the value rises while you've got cash checked out.

I discovered this week that every time I used my on-paper crypto gains to secure a new investment loan, then spend it on business expansion (dedicated computer equipment in my case) I was actually reducing the amount of taxes I owed on my normal dayjob salary.


-----------------------

Here's a scenario: You make $10k a year, and you bought $1 worth of bitcoin. Time passes, and that $1 in BTC is now worth $200k. If you sell it, you're gonna owe a shitload of taxes.

Now, if you put $20k of your BTC into an account and pull out $12k cash against it, you can spend this money to buy yourself a new investment taxfree. Say you spend it to buy a restaurant. The restaurant pays out $1k before taxes come due.

Your taxable income for the year is now $10k + $1k - $12k = negative $1,000 in taxable income that year. Hello, tax return? Yes, plz.

Also, any interest you pay on that loan is a 'business expense' and further reduces how much tax you own on other profits that year.

This shit has changed my life, hope it helps some of you guys out too! 

-------------

This is the same method billion dollar corps use to constantly expand while owing little tax because they're ""operating at a loss"" due to tax deductions from using business expansion costs as a shield for their profits. 

Now, these tools are simply becoming available to regular people who can buy digital collateralizable assets $1 at a time, instead of needing to buy up deeds to land or yacht or other collateraliazble property first.

&amp;#x200B;

===GENERAL QUESTIONS===

Q: Is Celsius a bank?

A: NO, Celsius is not a bank. However, you can store either crypto or fiat currency (i.e. US dollars) in Celsius to earn interest rates &gt;6%. So in that way, Celsius acts similar functionally to a bank with superior returns. 

Q: Is Celsius profitable?

A: Yes, their business model is to give 80% of profit to depositors while retaining 20% for themselves. Because of this, Celsius adjusts interest rates for depositors as frequently as on a weekly basis. 

Q: How big is Celsius?

A: Celsius has the 2nd largest asset manager by AUM (assets under management) in the crypto space after GrayScale. - 

Q: Does Celsius have withdrawal fees?

A: No

Q: Why do other companies have withdrawal fees but Celsius doesn’t?

A: Celsius eats the cost of the withdrawal fees. That’s called customer service!

Q: Is there a limit on how often you can withdraw at Celsius?

A: Not currently (vs. BlockFi with 1 free withdrawal/month limit)

Q: Does Celsius mine Bitcoin?

A: Yes. Celsius has more hashpower from its mining operations than Riot, which is a publicly traded company valued at around $5 billion right now.

Q: Does Celsius loan out coins to short sellers?

A: In March 5th AMA, Alex said that Celsius doesn’t lend coins to directional traders (i.e. shorts) because that's where loss of funds occur, they only loan out coins to market makers

Q: Are all the CEL tokens distributed? Do they still need to be mined?

A: Yes, they’re all distributed already. 

Q: How much CEL does Celsius own?

A: Celsius holds about 270m tokens of the 695m. You can see the comprehensive breakdown here   

Q: Where’s the stats on Celsius users?

A: Here -  (REDACTED)

Q: Does Celsius work with Chainlink?

A: Yes, Celsius will use and support Chainlink’s Price Reference Data to calculate interest payment amounts to users. This will:

• exploit a decentralised, transparent and highly secure approach

• create a smart contract audit trail of its lending operations.

This will ensure that all Celsius interest payments will rely on the increased security of the decentralised network of independent – and security reviewed – Sybil-resistant Chainlink nodes. This means Celsius can move towards a new level of security and reliability which take advantage of Chainlink’s approach to decentralisation. -  

Q: How long has Celsius been around?

A: Since 2017 -  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

===SECURITY QUESTIONS===

Q: How healthy is Celsius? Can it survive a security breach?

A: Stats for Celsius as of Feb 12, 2021

\- 8.75b AUM (excluded California due to no lending licence); now updated on app &amp; website

\- 400k signups total, 18k last week

\- 327m gross transfers

\- 88m net deposits

\- 1m paid in promocodes last week

\- 5.8m paid in interest last week

Q: Celsius isn’t FDIC insured.

A: (1) FDIC insurance isn’t even big enough to cover the megabanks in the US from failing. (2) Celsius has $2 billion in reserves to a $10 billion AUM as of Feb 2021, while the Fed reserve requirement ratio for banks dropped to 0% during COVID-19, (3) several countries don’t have a FDIC insurance mechanism 

Q: Has Celsius been audited?

A: Yes, it was audited on Dec 2020 through Chainanalysis -   

Q: Does Celsius have insurance?

A: Celsius has insurance for its stored crypto, like most of its competitors. Problem is most of the coins on Celsius are loaned out at any given time, and no company has insurance on those coins right now. However, that’s mitigated by the fact that borrowers overcollateralize on Celsius. ALSO, YES Celsius IS coming out with opt-in insurance later in 2021.

Q: Who does Celsius custody with?

A: They use BitGo for coins in cold storage and Fireblocks for coins in hot wallets. See AMA here -  

Q: Can I trust the Celsius team? What’s their backgrounds?

A: Celsius puts security as a top priority--you can see this with app UI and withdrawal process that sacrifices convenience in order to mitigate user mistakes/hacks (users are often the weakest link and Celsius designs around this); a big, dedicated security team of Israeli cybersecurity professionals with an ""unlimited budget""; and the fact that Celsius has NEVER BEEN HACKED, unlike Ledger, Blockfi (), Nexus Mutual (), Binance (/)...the list goes on; and the use of Multiparty Computation (MPC) for securing funds internally (), which is the cutting edge of enterprise-grade encryption and security (). The fact that BlockFi got hacked on a SIM Swap is kinda shameful tbh. That's pretty much the 2nd thing everyone warns you about in crypto--don't use SMS based 2FA!!! (Note SMS based 2FA is not an option on the Celsius app)

Q: Is there like a technical architecture slide that shows the Celsius security stack?

A: Yes!  (URL Redacted)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

===TRANSACTION QUESTIONS===

Q: How does Celsius make money? It sounds too good to be true!

A: Celsius uses coins transferred by their customers as collateral for lending, rehypothecation, and other similar transactions. This works for a couple of reasons. (1) Celsius is one of the few organizations that accepts crypto as collateral, because JP Morgan certainly doesn’t. That enables Celsius to charge its borrowers a much higher interest rate than normally. 

Q: What if Bitcoin drops drastically?

A: Celsius overcollateralizes its loans.   

Q: Do you have proof that Celsius can survive a 50% Bitcoin drop?

A: In March 2020, Bitcoin dropped over 40% in a single day and Celsius was unaffected. 

Q: I have Bitcoin in my Celsius account, can I convert that to USDC or Ethereum?

A: Not yet, but in-app swaps are coming out later in 2021

Q: Can I connect my bank account to Celsius and buy Bitcoin directly?

A: Yes

Q: Can I buy crypto on Celsius through a credit card?

A: Yah but the fees are pretty high to do it that way so we recommend you fund your account in different ways

Q: What is CEL?

A: CEL is a “cryptocurrency” created by Celsius which sole purpose is to enable users to generate higher yield on their total portfolio if a certain % of their holdings are in the CEL token. For example, if I have a $10,000 account, and $3000 of that is in CEL token (with the rest in bitcoin), then my interest rate on Bitcoin would go up from 4% to 6%. This motivates users of Celsius to buy/hold the CEL token. 

Q: Is CEL the same thing as Celsius?

A: No. Celsius Network is the name of the company where you can deposit your crypto to earn interest. CEL is the name of a cryptocurrency token created by Celsius to assist with some of its mechanics.

Q: Can I buy CEL if I’m in the US?

A: No, Celsius considers CEL a security and only allows accredited investors to buy it. HOWEVER, you can buy most of the major cryptocurrencies (i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.) on Celsius. The SEC hasn’t officially ruled CEL a security, but Celsius is being cautious and following the law. If you make income &gt;$200k or have a net worth &gt;$1 million, you can buy CEL directly from the company by emailing them 

Q: Why can’t I buy CEL on exchanges? That’s sorta sketchy.

A: Alex has stated that Celsius doesn’t want to pay the exchange fees to list on Coinbase and other exchanges. With that said, you can buy CEL on BitFinex. 

Q: How can I buy CEL if I’m in the US then if I'm not rich?

A: You can use Uniswap or have an existing CEL user transfer CEL to your wallet.

Q: It’s taking me forever to transfer my USD to crypto, how long does this normally take???

A: Normally it takes 7 complete days at minimum, and can take a couple weeks max. It’s annoying, especially for new crypto users who aren’t use to / don’t know how long transactions can take.

Q: Is there a fee for buying crypto with Celsius? 

A: You pay in the spread, which is about 1%.

Q: Is there a fee for transferring crypto to Celsius?

A: You pay the gas fee for ERC-20 tokens (Ethereum-based tokens)

Q: How can I buy CEL if I’m NOT in the US?

A: Liquid, BitFinex, FTX, Uniswap

Q: Does Celsius participate in DeFi activity with our deposited coins?

A: Yes

This is not advice, just person observation.

* Polygon (MATIC coin) already has adoption - polkadot too.
* Polygon can do what Polkadot can do and more via alternative L2 options for Ethereum
* Polygon has ALL of the developer environment and tools of Ethereum - polkadot leans on Ethereum too, but not quiet the same transferability. Polygon has a clear advantage here.
* Polygon has the security of Ethereum as well as reach to Ethereum-based projects that want scalability-Polkadot does NOT have that.
* Polygon's development was supported by TWO **competing** highest-profile exchanges, Coinbase (ventures) and Binance, which is uncommon
* Polygon (MATIC) is trading on Coinbase before Polkadot, an attribute of due diligence

It seem the Polygon is better situated as a hub for the ""internet of blockchains"" than Polkadot. Again, I like both projects a great deal, and this sector of blockchains is likely to become huge with room for both. **But the current marketcap of these two projects makes little sense to me**.

At the time of this post, Polkadot marketcap is &gt;$30 billion, while MATIC (polygon) is &lt;3 billion, greater than a order of magnitude difference, &gt;10X. I do not see the logic in this.

On top of Binances 10M investment into Denko’s project. AR has stepped in and invested 20M into Reef holdings. 

There is a lot of FUD around this project and rightly so. Denko is promising a lot to the community! But the fact that many institutions and exchanges are behind this project is just beautiful. 

Many talk about the circulating supply increase after the huge run up on the first day. Denko decided to increase the circulating supply so the coin would not just take off and be VERY volatile. Very smart in my eyes. Keeping investors happy. 

Another aspect I look at is user experience. You all know of Apple and let’s say Robinhood for example. Are there better tech alternatives to these products? Absolutely. So why do they do so well? 

BECAUSE OF USER EXPERIENCE. 

And that is what Denko is bringing to the Defi world. 

Creating a parachain to be able to secure liquidity from both DEX and CEX. Nothing that has ever been done before. Ultimately the first ever DeFi block chain. 

The debit card. This is the most interesting concept. Because theoretically, they can become a decentralized bank. Allowing you full control of your liquidity and spending. 

The stable coin. USDT pair that will have governance. Very smart! Look at voyager token and such. Governance is key! 


The road map is very intricate and the team has been delivering!! 

Here are some links to information about the project.

The public as well as businesses are looking for a way to pay and spend their cryptocurrencies and it is bringing a lot of interests and players from unlikely places. So here is a quick list and my opinions on them.

Bitcoin / Ethereum - While they are widely accepted and valid for big item purchases, most stay away due to high fees and and slow transactions. You would finish your coffee before paying for it sadly.

Stablecoin - While its the most ""natural"" of transitions, most are Ethereum ERC-20's, the transaction speed and gas fees are an issue.

Ripple / Stellar - Both with the same aim but different ways of getting about it. If the foreign exchange markets can teach us anything is that high speed and low fees are crucial in making trades happen.

Nano / Banano - Fast and feeless is amazing but acceptance is what's hindering its adoption as there are few locations one can spend them. Once this is overcome however...

Litecoin / Doge - Joint mining means fast and cheap transactions and being a first generation crypto also means plenty of infrastructure available. The trouble is the acceptance of merchants as well as the public to use them as a currency.

Monero - Privacy is very important, but while it's not really slow, it may not be fast enough...

If you don't have these coins in your phone wallet as a way to pay for small ticket purchases, consider it. Create a crypto exchange amongst friends for meals. Don't shun paying for someone else's lunch if that offers an opportunity to diversify your holdings. 

Are there any other coins I have missed out on? Drop a comment or your opinions as I'm sure this will bring about lively (civil) discussions."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1891431|public|self|"The Crypto ""Currency"" arms race"|0|[]|0.63|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m3x7md/the_crypto_currency_arms_race/|all_ads|6|1615582953.0||dark|5b762856-d7c9-11e4-822a-22000b2300b2|||||||||||||||||2021-03-13 02:32:33+00:00|t3_m3x7md|0|2||

There have been lots of scams with people selling Ledgers already initialized with pre-loaded 24 word pass phrases.

If you must go that route, be sure to reset the device as soon as it arrives to generate a new phrase. (Probably a good idea to do, anyway and I'll tell you why later.)

You should have to create your own PIN. If you don't have to do that, your device was tampered with.

The device should come with a blank card to write your phrase on. If it comes with a card that has 24 words on it already, it was tampered with.

The reason it is a good idea to rest your device anyway after setting it up (assuming it is legit) is that it is a good way to test your 24 word phrase.

So you want to do this:

1 - Set up your device.

2 - Make note of some of the addresses of some cryptos. (You can also send a very small amount of crypto that you don't mind losing to an address on the device)

3 - Reset the device by putting in the wrong PIN three times.

4 - Use your 24 word phrase to restore the device.

5 - If the addresses are the same/the tiny amount of crypto you sent is still there that means you've written your 24 word phrase down properly. If not, you made a mistake somewhere.

(As you can probably tell, the reason that you want to confirm you've written your phrase down properly asap is because you don't want to load the device with lots of valuable crypto only to find out when you need to restore it that you wrote the phrase down wrong when you first got it.)

Are there any workarounds for the high gas fees that Ethereum has right now? Even though the money I invest isn’t going to break me if I loose it I much rather preffer to have it in my own wallet.

A lot of the time, the things like this that are disliked, but somehow seem to always work, are not \*really\* disliked by the community at large. Clickbait titles, as long as they're not outright lies, are difficult to get around.

LinusTechTips has talked about this in the past - Linus goes into detail about why many of their thumbnails and titles are so clickbaity in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiV8eXJgzys) (it's long), and another LTT staff member wrote about it [here on Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/agmgj9/can_we_please_stop_the_click_baiting/ee7x9e4/).

I hate the obvious sensationalism too, but it works. And you could have, for example, the best damn DD in the world, but if you gave it an ""accurate"" title with zero sensationalism, nobody would click on it.

I'd compare it to ""everyday low price"" strategies that some major retailers have tried out. [JCPenny famously fired their CEO](https://nytimes.com/2013/04/14/business/for-penney-a-tough-lesson-in-shopper-psychology.html) after it resulted in a major reduction in sales, and the same thing happened when places like Macy's and Walmart tried this strategy.

Yeah, I think the constant raising of prices and then having ""sales"" all of the time is pretty silly and manipulative, but collectively, we still like the illusion of getting a good deal. Even people who know that manipulative sales strategies aren't saving them any money often end up voting for them with their wallet.

And it's the same with clickbait. Many of us say we hate it, but we still tend to click on that content rather than the content we say we prefer. It seems more like we hate the idea of clickbait than clickbait itself."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1891620|public|self|Unpopular opinion: Clickbaity titles like this are necessary|0|[]|0.28|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m3y1jc/unpopular_opinion_clickbaity_titles_like_this_are/|all_ads|6|1615585995.0||||||self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Vh9dVHZ9ItvMX8zYuwIfattlFhDArxsOPsY-4ri3Wmc', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xygPyrrKdRvhxPKt1QdoZy3AqyL653-C3KRNrz2IAy8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b848cc1e33fcef01b33baa16efbb99a3b3af0109', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xygPyrrKdRvhxPKt1QdoZy3AqyL653-C3KRNrz2IAy8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90d54d3bacd5d9048e93da86f8dd2541e1d6c6ca', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xygPyrrKdRvhxPKt1QdoZy3AqyL653-C3KRNrz2IAy8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=953783112492a090c6414a5a70579b912a3d1b3a', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/xygPyrrKdRvhxPKt1QdoZy3AqyL653-C3KRNrz2IAy8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=22f7ff0f7a73cc7a8f9862dc375bf442f866a9e0', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||||||2021-03-13 03:23:15+00:00|t3_m3y1jc|0|0||

Or if I had taken out a loan of 10k back when I was thinking about it, I'd have this much now. But my past self didn't know how things would play out. No one does. 

So instead, I look at the charts and ask myself, If I take out 10k loan right now and ask myself, where should I put that 10k now for it to be more in the future.... I don't know.

So instead, every paycheck, I take out anywhere from 25$ to 25%... what ever I can afford... and put it in crypto. It's gotten to a point where my Crypto portfolio is now rivaling my 401k that i've been building for the last 4 years with my company's matching program.

So Even if there are ups and downs, I keep buying. For example. I bought at the beginning of this week, then multiple projects have dropped anywhere from 5 to 20% and it's ok. I'll keep an eye on things, but I keep telling myself that time in the market is better than timing the market.

This happened just after ATH was reached in 2017. It's interesting comparing then to now. Even though bitcoin went 5x since September 2020, it never reached the volume of searches globally that it reached in 2017. Additionally, the volume of searches for bitcoin now, as BTC is close to ATH, is the same volume in 2018 after bitcoin crashed 50% from the 2017 ATH to roughly 9k a coin. A bit strange, no?

I'm not sure what this means for the price action. It's pretty wild seeing such a stark difference though. It makes me wonder if the 2017 spike and crash made a ton of people bitter, and that's why less people are excited about it now.

Metcalf's Law will dictate which branch of the fork succeeds (from an investors perspective). Therefore, miners and devs are really at war over the *PERCEIVED* future of the ethereum network because ultimately the users will decide which branch succeeds.

To be a bit more realistic, coinbase, tether, WBTC, renBTC etc will decide which branch succeeds by deciding which branches tokens can be reclaimed for dollars and bitcoins. All of the DeFi users will migrate according to these projects selections.

Finally, if you aren't a miner or dev, you don't really have much to worry about. You're going to have tokens on both branches after the fork anyway.

TL,DR: Unfortunately we are just along for the ride as the 'too big to fail' projects make the decision for us."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|1890261|public|self|EIP1559 and Metcalf's Law.

When it was added to Whitebit it soared and now it is being added to BKEK soon. This coin may be volatile but it is definitely going to grow, it has a lot more on the roadmap. This is still the ground floor. You will see posts next week about how much it has grown.

You can get it on Uniswap or Whitebit if not in the U.S.. It is even now 1inch.

To get Hoge on Uniswap you need to install Metamask into your browser, as an extension, and transfer ethereum into your wallet. After that you have to go to the below Uniswap link, which is also on the hoge.finance page. You need to adjust slippage, maybe 3% and account for gas fees. If it works you can still reject it after seeing the fees. I generally see what the fees are, reject it and readjust so I transfer as much as I can. You are better off making a larger purchase than a few small ones. The price of gas changes, I think based on processing demand, so some times are less but that means waiting.

[https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?slippage=500&amp;outputCurrency=0xfad45e47083e4607302aa43c65fb3106f1cd7607](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?slippage=500&amp;outputCurrency=0xfad45e47083e4607302aa43c65fb3106f1cd7607)

You then may want to go to your Metamask and add Hoge as a custom token so you can see it. You can even trade it back to ethereum if you want, then to wherever.

It is a nuisance but when it becomes easier and is on more exchanges you will be glad you got it before more people have access to it.
