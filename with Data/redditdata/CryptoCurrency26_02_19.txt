Personally what still makes me hesitant:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Tether**, oh boy haven't we heard this now for about 1 ½ years. But for me it is still very, very, very risky to let Tether be the backbone of all liquidity in the crypto markets. If I am not mistaken, about 85 % of all volume for Bitcoin is in Tether.  
Do you guys remember this past fall when Tether broke it's peg and went below 90 cents, then redeemed $900 Million USDT, the price of Bitcoin crashed just shortly afterwards, and that crash did **not** look natural at all. The $6000 level looked as if it was artificially held.  
Then Tether [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-says-customers-can-once-again-deposit-and-redeem-fiat) on November 27th that they would make a redeemable system and would not be using Bitfinex as their proxy for USD &lt;-&gt; USDT anymore. However, not **ONE** redeemed USDT has been recorded besides Bitfinex since it's inception almost 3 months ago, you can see this [here at the Treasury](https://www.omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) for Tether.
2. **Bitfinex**, same old here too. The issues they've had with fiat withdrawals and their connections with companies such as Crypto Capital and Noble Bank does not look good, it looks very much alike QuadrigaCX.
3. **Mt.Gox** **redistribution of 150 000 + BTC**, many crypto holders blamed Mt.Gox as the source for the 2018 crash, since they sold off 30 000 BTC. I think this was mostly a false narrative, however the proceedings with Mt.Gox is going forward and the BTC could start to get redistributed this year. Hopefully we will know more at March 20th when they will hold their next committee meeting.
4. **Market correlation** and **amount of dead/copied/irrational** projects with tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of valuation. This makes it hard to see like we're getting close to a rational market.
5. **Fake volume / Leverage trading / Market manipulation**, this point goes hand in hand and explains some of the Bart action we get every now and then. Whales can enter leverage positions, then wash trade or simply buy on the market and profit their leverage trades. That's probably not going to be a good thing in the market, besides for the whales doing the manipulation.  


  
I also see great potential in crypto, but we discuss that 24/7, so I thought we could try to look at this market as objectively as possible.  
Hope you guys can fill in with more!"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|850288|public|self|What are the biggest risks you currently see for the crypto market in 2019?|1553262123|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/autcro/what_are_the_biggest_risks_you_currently_see_for/|all_ads|6|1551125542.0||||||||||||||2019-02-26 01:42:22+00:00|t3_autcro|0|77|0.84||0|

**TL;DR: Uninstall Moon, Revoke your Coinbase API Keys NOW**

I am the co-founder and CTO at [https://paywithmoon.com](https://paywithmoon.com/). Due to the unethical business practices Moon Technologies, Inc. has been engaged in, I have left the company.

As of today, the moon browser extension manipulates the DOM of all our users' browsers to give them an augmented shopping experience, one that allows them to shop online with cryptocurrency. Over the past couple of months, my co-founder, Kenneth Kruger, has ordered the collection of data belonging to our users as a way to improve customer experiences. None of our users have ever been asked explicitly if they would prefer to opt-out of tracking, a feature which I regularly insisted should be added. If you are a user and look under at terms and conditions stated under [https://paywithmoon.com/terms-conditions/](https://paywithmoon.com/terms-conditions/) (dated 26 Feb 2019), you will find the agreement hidden under one of the terms and conditions.

From the moment you install our browser extension, we know exactly what pages are open on your browser, what the content of those pages are, and what you are doing with them.

The biggest and most alarming issue of all, is the process of collection of how our browser extension works in the backend - Coinbase API keys. From the moment the user initiates the connection between us and Coinbase, we watch for changes in the user's current window, waiting for the user to complete the one-time passcode (OTP) verification process as required by Coinbase. Once that is done, we programatically click the required permissions (scopes) required to create the API key as Moon sees fit.

The API key is then shown only once on the next screen, but the user does not know this (done via CSS manipulation). We extract the API keys into our backend, stored in **plain text** on our database. This is a definite security antipattern as I'm sure many of you know. **This API key is then able to be used indefinitely until manually revoked by the individual user**.

When I asked my co-founder why we should not encrypt the keys or create recursively locking IAM policies to prevent anyone in the management team to have **personal** access to our users' API keys, my co-founder constantly avoided or redirected the discussion and prevented me from building any kind of system that would protect our users.

Only two days ago, I have been locked out of my organization accounts including AWS and can no longer take preventive measures to protect my users.

**If you are a user of our browser extension today, \*\*\*PLEASE\*\*\* you need to uninstall the browser extension via*****chrome://extensions*** **and go into** [***https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api***](https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api) **and revoke ALL your API keys NOW.**

If you have not used the Moon browser extension, but know of a friend that might, please inform him or her to do so immediately.

My deteriorating relationship with my co-founder has grown to a point where it simply can no longer be contained. You can read more about my experience in another post here [https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/au668p/what\_to\_do\_in\_the\_event\_you\_get\_zuckerberged\_in\_a/](https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/au668p/what_to_do_in_the_event_you_get_zuckerberged_in_a/).

I had created Moon as I was crazy enough to think I was able to change the world with the single vision of bringing mass adoption to cryptocurrency, accelerating the future of the financial system. However, today is truly a sad day for crypto. Until we can find a way to completely decentralize and move away from the corporations, the no-accountability attitude and greed many executives possess, we cannot hope to bring forth the dream of cryptocurrency.

Until we meet on the moon again, please be safe, not sorry,

I recently came across a new crypto/hardware company, [AMMBR](https://www.ammbr.com/), doing an ICO that contains at least 7 former members of the infamous Butterfly Labs company in varying capacities.

Interestingly enough, my curiosity was ~~peaked~~ piqued as a family member who was involved with BFL mentioned this project on Facebook and I automatically knew there had to be a connection to BFL because that family member knows practically nothing about cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, it seems he has not learned from his mistakes and is still participating in shady, possibly illicit activities, along with many of his former butts!

I’m now going to connect the dots for you to the people associated with SCAMMBR to show beyond a reasonable doubt that they are a quasi-reincarnation of BFL.

If you go to their website, [www.ammbr.com](https://www.ammbr.com/), you can see their team members. Here are some of note:

***1.) FORMER BFL Chief Technology Officer: Nasser Ghoseiri***

Nasser was the Iranian living in France and one of the three named defendants in the case brought against BFL by the FTC which BFL lost.

Jeff is the infamous character who pulled the trick of buying [Buttcoin.org](https://buttcoin.org/) surreptitiously and then chanigng the negative articles to positive. Jeff isn’t listed on the official site, but he’s always worked behind the scenes from my experience as he was never listed as a BFL employee either. While he doesn’t list BFL on his LinkedIn profile, it’s fairly obvious when you read his experience at ForceStream.

Guess who else is on the team? After checking out their team page, I saw a photo with a few familiar faces. Wanna know who they are?

[SCAMMBR TEAM](https://i.redd.it/1x9f2tce4yi21.png)

**NOTABLE FIGURES IN PIC:**

1.) Third from the left is **The Infamous Josh Zerlan, aka Inaba, aka** [**u/NitroWolf**](https://np.reddit.com/u/NitroWolf)**, aka BagO’Dicks, former VP of Product Dev at BFL,** and now apparently consulting or a part of SCAMMBR according to the “Projects” section of his LinkedIn profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-zerlan-a4140478/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-zerlan-a4140478/)

2.) Four spots to the right of Josh is T**he Infamous Dave “The Knife” Mcclain, aka ""THE MOLE""**, **former BFL Account Manager**, who seems to be a part of it as well as he is pictured on their website with their team in a photo which also includes Josh. Not sure what he does there as he has little understanding of cryptocurrency or just about any technical development since the VCR.

**BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE!**

SCAMMBR was originally founded in 2017.

(SOURCE: [https://tokenmarket.net/blockchain/blockchain/assets/ammbr/](https://tokenmarket.net/blockchain/blockchain/assets/ammbr/))

However it had two main issues which found itself on the dead coin list until it was recently resurrected, one being lack of interest/exchange listings and the other being a major security vulnerability in the smart contract, and the third being that anything BFL touches turns to shit.

**ISSUE ONE:** According to the Coinopsy link above, among other interesting reasons, they proclaimed that: *“Ammbr was founded in 2017 and is not trading on any exchanges. Was added to the dead coins list due to the fact they did not reach any exchanges after one year and they canceled the ICO.”*

**ISSUE TWO:THE SCAMMBR SMART CONTRACT BUG:**

**(SOURCE:** [**https://medium.com/coinmonks/an-inspection-on-ammbr-amr-bug-a53b4050d52**](https://medium.com/coinmonks/an-inspection-on-ammbr-amr-bug-a53b4050d52))

While this bug affected many ERC-20 contracts, on July 8th, 2018, *“John Wick Security Lab revealed highly risky transactions in* [*AMMBR(AMR)*](https://ammbr.com/) *contract. It contains an integer overflow bug that could be made use of by hackers calling batchTransfer(), resulting in transferring out tokens without limits.”*

This can be seen in this tweet by SCAMMBR where they had to change the smart contract:

**WE'RE NOT DONE YET! SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST!**

After doing further research on the SCAMMBR website, because nothing BFL is involved with is ever like it seems, I found some suspect/fake/front companies and astroturfing.

[r/AMMBRPlatform](https://np.reddit.com/r/AMMBRPlatform)

By all accounts, that sub is highly suspected of astroturfing by shills, employees and their families. Very few posts concern the actual project and the mods are mostly absent. All of the posts repeat the same lines or hashtags, but no comments. Mod [u/Jory-](https://np.reddit.com/u/Jory-) doesn't post much in cryptocurrency subs, while [u/AMMBRPlatform](https://np.reddit.com/u/AMMBRPlatform) has never posted.

**BLACKBIRD WALLET IS THE BFL BITSAFE:**

This is one of my favorite finds as it didn't occur to me until after doing most of my research, but then it clicked suddenly that I knew the design.

BITCOINTALK: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4685822.msg%msg\_id%](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4685822.msg%25msg_id%25)

SCAMMBRTECH posted on Bitcointalk on 7/16/18 regarding a new mobile wallet that has yet to come to market, the Blackbird Hardware Wallet. I had never heard of it and apparently, they wanted $299 for it from their shop. Which is...ridiculous. But let's compare the Blackbird Wallet to the BFL Bitsafe that was never released:

Why are people buying coins just because a company has some nice partnerships or great products, but none of this actually matters for their token because it's not needed or used in their project?

# General definition

A distributed network consensus is a method of independent nodes reaching a common solution. The main goal of consensus is a stable operation of the network of nodes where rounds reproduce either with a certain frequency or an algorithm themselves cyclically measuring continuous life of ordered interactions of the nodes like a logical core of the electronic system. The consensus is capable of performing additional tasks, such as processing transactions, verifying smart contracts’ execution, being a basis for the operation of the distributed system for launching applications or any other payload which requires reaching consensus.

&gt;[Advanced version of this article for true blockchain geeks.](https://credits.com/Content/Docs/CDCA.pdf)

# Consensus Reaching

After all network nodes released transactions packages and exchanged them with each other, nodes responsible for consensus execution need to be selected and those nodes will have to validate transactions and generate a block. In the very beginning, network launch starts from Genesis-block formation and The Big Bang. Afterward, the network operates in cycles due to the rotation of rounds and constant selection of new Trusted Nodes for consensus execution.

# Formation of the list of Trusted Nodes (TN).

The algorithm of operations of all nodes implies that if a node has an up-to-date blockchain, then during generation of the last block it has to calculate the hash of the block and send it to all Trusted Nodes of the next round whose public keys are contained in the meta block.

The trusted node of the current round in turn upon receiving the last block’s hash forms a preliminary list of the candidates to become a TN in the next round. Then, based on this information final list of next round TNs will be determined and included in the new metablock. If the hash is not correct, the node is marked as “incorrect”.

After a block is generated and recorded in the blockchain, nodes send a request to the TNs of the next round to include them in the list of candidates for becoming a TN.

# Validation of transactions and formation of characteristic function

Trusted Node validates transactions in the list of transactions of the round formed on the node. It should be noted that the process of transactions validation is performed on each node for all transactions independently from other nodes and only upon this process conclusion the nodes can exchange information about the results.

During validation, the following is checked:

1. If all transaction fields are filled correctly; (is valid)
2. If a transaction is unique (exclusion of “double spending”)
3. If the transaction signature is correct;
4. If after the transaction is made the balance is more than 0.

[Formation of an indicator \(characteristic function\)](https://i.redd.it/0udw7obu1si21.jpg)

&gt;The result of validation is a characteristic function (Indicator) - a sequence of bits, where 1 means valid transaction and 0 - invalid.

This price for a ticket is valid only until March, then it will be $1!   


By the way, each ticket has not 1, but as many as 7 chances to win.And money raffles take place almost everyday - quite often, aren't they?   
Hourly and daily raffles   


And yes, don't think that this is usual financial pyramid.   
Look yourself:   
In the lottery, there are open source smart contracts with Ether that guarantee its integrity.   
And the system Oraclize will ensure the openness of random number generation, which means no one can influence the outcome!

If you leave a comment, make it in english please.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Read the guide &lt;a href=""https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/blob/master/translation-tips.md""&gt;Tips for Monero Translators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you find an empty string, just ignore it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Support&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For any question or clarification, you can contact me or the localization workgroup:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;#monero-translations - Live chat for support and coordination, on Freenode (IRC), but relayed on &lt;a href=""https://mattermost.getmonero.org""&gt;MatterMost&lt;/a&gt; and matrix/riot)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Translate[at]getmonero[dot]org&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can also contact me here, on Wire or Telegram (ErCiccione on all of them)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The GitHub repo: &lt;a href=""https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations""&gt;monero-translations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'Monero', 'subreddit_id': 't5_31hbr', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/Monero', 'subreddit_subscribers': 155840, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': '[URGENT]Call for translators! - We have two days to submit as many translations as possible for the next release of the GUI wallet!

Just thought I'd share with you a live demonstration of my favorite crypto project. This is the Particl Open Marketplace that's going mainnet in late Q1. The application is entirely decentralized, meaning image hosting, escrow, moderation, payments, etc...everything is decentralized and doesn't require middlemen.   


I believe this is exactly how blockchain products should be made if they want to have a shot at mainstream adoption. I'm tired of the countless Qt wallets going around, it's 2019 for god's sake xD   


I'd also be very curious to see demos from other live blockchain products! If you got any video of a good looking and serious blockchain project, please link it here :)  


Cheers all!

We will accept deposits for a minimum of 12 hours prior to enabling full trading. Please note that inbound transfers require the specification of an XRP destination tag.
Once sufficient supply of XRP is established on the platform, trading on the XRP/USD, XRP/EUR, and XRP/BTC order books will start in phases, beginning with post-only mode and proceeding to full trading should our metrics for a healthy market be met. XRP trading will initially be accessible for Coinbase Pro users in the US (excluding NY), UK, supported European Union member nations, Canada, Singapore, and Australia. Additional jurisdictions may be added at a later date.
XRP is the cryptocurrency used by the XRP ledger, which supports international currency exchange and remittances. The ledger is powered by a network of peer-to-peer servers. All accounts on this network can send or receive XRP to/from each other, while XRP can be used to send underlying fiat currencies between two parties. In this way, XRP can function as a bridge currency in transactions involving different currencies such as US dollars, Japanese yen, Euros, Francs, and others in use on the XRP network.
Please also note that XRP is not yet available on Coinbase.com or via our mobile apps. We will make a separate announcement when that occurs.
The Stages of the XRP Launch
There will be four stages to the launch as outlined below. We will follow each of these stages independently for each new order book. If at any point one of the new order books does not meet our assessment for a healthy and orderly market, we may keep the book in one state for a longer period of time, or suspend trading as per our Trading Rules.
We will send tweets from our Coinbase Pro Twitter account as each order book moves through the following phases:
Transfer-only. Starting after 10am PT on Feb. 25, customers will be able to transfer XRP into their Coinbase Pro account. Customers will not yet be able to place orders and no orders will be filled on these order books. Order books will be in transfer-only mode for at least 12 hours.
Post-only. In the second stage, customers can post limit orders but there will be no matches (completed orders). Order books will be in post-only mode for a minimum of one minute.
Limit-only. In the third stage, limit orders will start matching but customers are unable to submit market orders. Order books will be in limit-only mode for a minimum of ten minutes.
Full trading. In the final stage, full trading services will be available, including limit, market, and stop orders.
One of the most common requests we receive from customers is to be able to trade more assets on our platform. Per the terms of our listing process, we anticipate supporting more assets that meet our standards over time.
You can sign up for a Coinbase Pro account here to start trading.

We will accept deposits for a minimum of 12 hours prior to enabling full trading. Please note that inbound transfers require the specification of an XRP destination tag.
Once sufficient supply of XRP is established on the platform, trading on the XRP/USD, XRP/EUR, and XRP/BTC order books will start in phases, beginning with post-only mode and proceeding to full trading should our metrics for a healthy market be met. XRP trading will initially be accessible for Coinbase Pro users in the US (excluding NY), UK, supported European Union member nations, Canada, Singapore, and Australia. Additional jurisdictions may be added at a later date.
XRP is the cryptocurrency used by the XRP ledger, which supports international currency exchange and remittances. The ledger is powered by a network of peer-to-peer servers. All accounts on this network can send or receive XRP to/from each other, while XRP can be used to send underlying fiat currencies between two parties. In this way, XRP can function as a bridge currency in transactions involving different currencies such as US dollars, Japanese yen, Euros, Francs, and others in use on the XRP network.
Please also note that XRP is not yet available on Coinbase.com or via our mobile apps. We will make a separate announcement when that occurs.
The Stages of the XRP Launch
There will be four stages to the launch as outlined below. We will follow each of these stages independently for each new order book. If at any point one of the new order books does not meet our assessment for a healthy and orderly market, we may keep the book in one state for a longer period of time, or suspend trading as per our Trading Rules.
We will send tweets from our Coinbase Pro Twitter account as each order book moves through the following phases:
Transfer-only. Starting after 10am PT on Feb. 25, customers will be able to transfer XRP into their Coinbase Pro account. Customers will not yet be able to place orders and no orders will be filled on these order books. Order books will be in transfer-only mode for at least 12 hours.
Post-only. In the second stage, customers can post limit orders but there will be no matches (completed orders). Order books will be in post-only mode for a minimum of one minute.
Limit-only. In the third stage, limit orders will start matching but customers are unable to submit market orders. Order books will be in limit-only mode for a minimum of ten minutes.
Full trading. In the final stage, full trading services will be available, including limit, market, and stop orders.
One of the most common requests we receive from customers is to be able to trade more assets on our platform. Per the terms of our listing process, we anticipate supporting more assets that meet our standards over time.

As far as I know, a stock price is influenced by how well the company is doing. If I got stocks from google and google does well, I gain money.

But how is this working with cryptocurrency. Let's say I got one Bitcoin, I can't really tell if bitcoin is doing good business right? There's just the coin without a company behind it. I can only wait for the technology to improve and for more places to accept Bitcoin. But what is there for me to gain, how do I help when I have Bitcoin?

If I got stocks from a company, the company gets money in return and I indirectly help them.
This is atleast as far as I understand all this, correct me if I'm wrong.

I would like to hear from you guys if there's any correlation between a cryptocurrency and the development of the coin itself.
