It’s no secret that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. This and a number of other characteristics make it an unusually effective candidate for tax loss harvesting strategies. This guide outlines what tax loss harvesting is, how you can use it to reduce your bitcoin and crypto tax liability.

Tax Loss Harvesting - What Is It?

Tax Loss Harvesting is the practice of selling a capital asset at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability. By realizing or “harvesting” a loss, investors are able to offset taxes on both gains and income. This is a tax reduction strategy commonly used in the world of stocks and securities. 

An Example

John buys $1,000 of Apple stock and $2,000 of Tesla stock in a given year. While holding these investments, the value of John’s Apple stock rises to $1,500 while Tesla drops to $1,700. John sells all of his Apple stock for $1,500.

Without Tax Loss Harvesting

Without harvesting his losses in Tesla stock, John has a $500 capital gain for the year from the sale of his Apple stock. John pays taxes on all $500 of this capital gain.

With Tax Loss Harvesting

Rather than continuing to hold his Tesla stock, John can harvest his losses in Tesla by selling before year-end. Capital gains and losses get summed together for the year resulting in either a net gain or loss. John’s net capital gain is now only $200 for the year ($500 - $300). In this scenario, John only pays taxes on $200 of net capital gains rather than $500.

Tax Loss Harvesting With Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are treated as property for tax purposes, exactly the same as stocks. This means that you can also strategically sell/trade crypto to harvest losses and reduce your tax liability. Unlike stocks however, cryptocurrencies have unique characteristics that make them even better candidates for tax loss harvesting. We discuss these below. 

Wash Sale Rules

A wash sale results when you incur a capital loss, and then buy the same security back within a 30-day window before or after the capital loss is incurred. This rule is designed to prevent investors from taking capital losses in one year and then immediately buying back the stock. The [**IRS specifically states**](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2016_publink100010601) that wash sale rules only apply to securities. Cryptocurrencies are property, not securities, as defined by [**IRS guidance**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf). This means that wash sales rules do not apply to cryptocurrency at this time.

Volatility

Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile—more so than traditional assets. This volatility means that investors regularly have opportunities to realize and harvest capital losses. The difficult part for investors is identifying which of their cryptocurrencies in their portfolio have the highest **cost basis** (original purchase price) when compared to the current market price. These are the assets that present the greatest opportunity for tax savings. [**CryptoTrader.Tax**](https://www.cryptotrader.tax/) has a tax loss harvesting tool built into the app that allows users to automatically identify which of their cryptocurrencies present the greatest loss harvesting opportunity.

An Example

Amy has made $15,000 in capital gains from investing in the stock market this year. Amy has also been investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum. In December, Amy imports her cryptocurrency transactions into CryptoTrader.Tax and notices that her investments are down over $20,000 for the year. To harvest these losses, Amy trades all of her cryptocurrencies into Litecoin (thus incurring a [**taxable event**](https://www.cryptotrader.tax/blog/when-do-you-owe-taxes-on-your-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency) and realizing her losses). Amy’s losses in cryptocurrency complete offset all of her stock market gains, and she’s left with a $5,000 capital loss for the year.

Net Capital Losses Up to $3,000 Offset Ordinary Income

Whenever total capital gains and losses for the year add up to a negative number, a net capital loss is incurred. If the net capital loss is less than or equal to $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and filing a separate tax return), then that entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income—like the income from your job. Net losses exceeding $3,000 are rolled forward to subsequent years.  

December 31st is the Cutoff - Time is of The Essence!

It is important to keep in mind that the tax year ends on Dec. 31st—even though the filing deadline isn’t until April 15th. This means that you must harvest your losses prior to the end of the year if you want them to impact that year’s taxes. Many investors delay only to realize that they could have saved money on their tax bill if they would have sold or realized losses back in December. By then it’s too late."|False|False|[]|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|950630|public|self|Guide on crypto tax loss harvesting|0|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ec4qc7/guide_on_crypto_tax_loss_harvesting/|all_ads|6|1576609021.0||dark||FINANCE|709d50a8-1deb-11e4-9b08-12313b0b24aa|FINANCE|self|{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Z0vCaRRRkt9ylnWgnNSn34e8uk71i5mwVPnFBV3BS5E', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/5U3qhoAPo5FLzwAbOeflFDyeDgvZA3tP8Eocc17woWo.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd4702cda0bf69c439edb76d392e4a34ecc2cb0c', 'width': 108}], 'source': {'height': 200, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/5U3qhoAPo5FLzwAbOeflFDyeDgvZA3tP8Eocc17woWo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=982ed28bc82aae77d64ea0a1adeab041693896eb', 'width': 200}, 'variants': {}}]}|||||||||2019-12-18 00:27:01+00:00|t3_ec4qc7|0|1|1.0||

The crowdfund smart contract has been written in such a way, that it should ensure delivery of the product - or at least protect you from no delivery by getting your entire contribution back. (see below)

The intended audience is mainly power-users, and by that I mean, people who know how to program (in Python), know their way in linux, bash and on the commandline... Or Raspberry pi makers. That being said, it should work for beginners as well, but expect at some point that you will probably have to get technical (It's intended to be run on a Raspberry pi 3 b, so sooner or later, you will at least need to update the device.). 

If you don't want to get your feet wet, don't buy it.

A lot of wallets and portfolio apps have been made, which is great, but I wanted something simple, and portable, - and not on a phone - where I had 100% control, so I wrote it in Python 3 (as I have been doing a lot of development in Python over the last few years). There's a lot of multicoinwallets out there now who somehow claim to be open source, but whose source is nowhere to be found. They USE opensource libraries, but the end product is closed. This will be COMPLETELY open sourced if crowdfund targets are met. It's not a wallet btw, it only tracks price.

The idea is very simple. You keep your entire portfolio as a csv file, and every time you adjust your portfolio, you add a line to the csv with the current date. This way you can easily build a version history of your portfolio.

I'm looking for people who like to play around with the code, optimize it for their own needs (and preferably contribute the enhancements back to the community.)

So expect the basics in UI-friendliness. (the web app is built with Flask and Vue). Check the website for a link to a Youtube screencast that demonstrates the app.

If you want to plugin data science tools, if you want to experiment with automating your portfolio at scale, and track your performance with a lot of data, this is the portfolio software for you.

(For example I included some scripts that auto update Livepeer balances from staking wallets.)

Apart from the portfolio software (which is not tied to the device btw, it works on any OS with Python installed), this is also a simple display, that shows you the rate of your top 10 coins. (the gadget...)

It probably looks like a ridiculous gadget, and to be honest, I don't mind at all, hence the website name [rocketclock.club](https://rocketclock.club), referring to the rocket meme. 

But in all fairness, I've been working on and off on this project for the last 2 years, but the first prototype has been on my desk for almost 2 years, and it has one very cool feature, that in my view, is priceless. 

It kept me calm. Holy crap, has this thing kept me calm throughout the bear market. No endless refreshing on Coinmarketcap, or my phone. Just this tiny device on my desk, with the e-ink refresh every 5 minutes. It's what has enabled me to focus on my work, on developing, and not be distracted by the market all the time. You would maybe think the opposite should've been true, but this has been my experience.

The e-ink display is also written in Python, so it could be easily adjusted if you want to include custom data. (Maybe you would like to replace the rocket with another emoticon or meme, that would be pretty easy).  
Market data is pulled from Coingecko, so please beware that its functionality depends for a large amount on this website. All that being said, I haven't experienced much downtime since I started using Coingecko.

or to receive a token send 0.25 ETH to:

(by sending you agree to the terms and conditions on the website)

(the price is 0.15 ETH and 0.10 ETH acts as collateral, which gets returned when you claim your download)

&amp;#x200B;

If the download is not delivered on time, you can withdraw your entire ETH contribution (price + collateral) as you can read in the smart contract.

(Please read the contract to understand how this works. The original smart contract was reprogrammed because somebody on the Bitcoin talk forum asked how I would guarantee the delivery of the download. The token you receive acts as a vote of approval. So here it is: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x96f0b742daa1216961f4caf846fea5af60733aeb#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0x96f0b742daa1216961f4caf846fea5af60733aeb#code))

&amp;#x200B;

The risk here is actually almost entirely on my side; talking about an industry's first ;)  
(unless I'm overlooking a bug in the contract, which I hope is not the case - I've tested it for weeks locally and on Ropsten testnet. So please, again; read the smart contract!)

My investigation started when someone in Richard Heart (RH)'s own Hexbad telegram channel posted [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) hashes showing [daily payouts to the Origin Address(OA) in the excess of 520 million hex](https://nm.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ebn8kn/is_a_copy_of_all_aa_hex_going_to_the_origin/).   The closeness of that number to the daily amount being paid out in the Adoption Amplifier(AA) caused people to suspect that a copy of the AA funds were also being sent to the OA.   This is something that is not supposed to be happening according to RH's explanation of the code design.   Upon further investigation it turned out that these 520+ million HEX payments to the OA were not coming from the AA, but rather it's a daily payout from the ""We are all Satoshi"" (WaaS)  bonus directly to the OA.    This is the bonus that is to be paid out proportionally to all stake holders after the initial BTC free claim and AA phase is over with.    Since a copy of all bonuses and penalties in HEX get paid to the OA, this bonus is also being paid proportionally on a  daily basis to the OA which amounts to about 520 million HEX per day.    So if you take a step back and are following along at home, approx 520 million HEX is being minted each day to real people donating their ETH to the project, and another 520 million HEX is getting sent straight to the OA on top of a copy of all of the other bonuses that are also going straight to the OA address.  As we all know, this is all on top of the flush address getting all the donated ETH free and clear.      

Now if that doesn't seem unbalanced enough... it gets worse.    I wondered what happens when the OA stakes this free daily HEX.  Does that give it a bigger share of The BigPayDay bonuses including the WaaS bonus of which a copy was already paid to the OA?   When I asked RH directly about this in telegram his response was that the OA only gets paid the bonus once and does not get any interest from staking... HOWEVER...  As [RH admitted on a livestream yesterday](https://youtu.be/VY4xY09h0yc?t=5219)   
what has the OA been doing with it's HEX tokens?  In RH's own words ""It's moved it to 10 or 12 different addresses, and those addresses have staked for mostly 10 years.""   What this effectively means is that those same HEX tokens in the OA that were created as a copy of the WaaS bonus out of thin air, are now being staked for 10 years in other addresses, and YES these address will get another chunk of the WaaS bonus + interest that is meant to benefit all of the other HEX stakers.     When I came back to Richard and asked him about this a second time he admitted that this is true, and I have all of the chat screenshots to prove it.    When I asked him if he thought this design was problematic he chose to ignore me and respond to another troll in the chat rather than respond to my valid criticism of his project.     


My final response to him was this:

""Why are you responding to the troll and not my honest criticism.   At this point I'm beginning to shift and see that the point of HEX is to enrich you and a select group of your friends.  Wealth is being sucked from the masses into your pockets, and you are ok with this.   Its looking less altruistic and more greedy day by day as I learn more of the inner workings of HEX""

Are all faucets created equal?  They are not... Alright I know this isn\'t the Gettysburg address but who doesn\'t love Lincoln?\n\nHere I have compiled The best **Fun and Profitable Cryptocoin Faucet List** for you.  If you like this list you may use it to sign up for these great faucets and claim Bitcoin as well as many different Altcoins.  These are referral links so I might get some fantastic referrals like you in exchange for creating this hopefully useful list. \n\nOne thing you will need is patience, if you are going to try to get some bitcoins or altcoins for free.  it\'s not really free basically you are being given a very tiny amount of crypto-currency for watching internet advertising or for competing in games or challenges.

The goal of this post is to discuss how to handle your losses and the important things that you need to keep in mind for reducing your tax liability.

## Losses on Crypto and Bitcoin trades offset other capital gains

For tax purposes in the U.S., selling crypto is treated the same as selling any other type of capital asset—stocks, bonds, property etc. This means that you realize a capital gains or capital losses anytime you sell Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. When you realize a capital gain (you sold your crypto for more than you purchased it for), you owe a tax on the dollar amount of the gain. However, when you sell (or trade) your crypto for less than you purchased it for, you incur a capital loss, and you can use this loss to offset gains from other trades or even a gain from the sale of other property like stocks in your portfolio.  

Unfortunately in the crypto landscape that we are currently experiencing, there are plenty of losses to go around, and it is wise to file these capital losses in order to reduce your taxable income and save you money.

## Net capital losses up to $3,000 can be deducted against other types of income

Whenever your total capital gains and losses for the year add up to a negative number, you incur a [**net capital loss**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-loss-carryover.asp). If the net capital loss is less than or equal to $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and filing a separate tax return), then that entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income—like the income from your job.

If your losses exceed $3,000, then the amount over $3,000 will be rolled forward to the next tax year.  

It's very important to note that **before** being used to offset other types of income, capital losses offset other types of capital gains. This can provide HUGE tax benefits for people who have capital gains in other areas.

## What does this look like in real life?

Let’s go through an example to paint a clear picture.

Let's say you gained $20,000 in the stock market this year (this is a capital gain), and you lost $20,000 trading cryptocurrency. Your loss in crypto would completely offset your 20K stock market gain. Therefore, you would pay no taxes on your stock market activity. If you are at a 25% tax bracket, this form of tax loss harvesting would save you $5,000 in taxes (20,000 \* 0.25).

\*Note, there are many other forms of capital gains that your crypto can offset.

Tax loss harvesting is a common strategy used by investors of all asset classes: crypto, stocks, bonds, real-estate etc. 

## What if I have no other forms of capital gains?

In the scenario where you have no other capital gains, your losses simply offset your income up to $3,000.

As an example, let’s say you started 2019 doing really well as a crypto trader. You made $5,000 trading Bitcoin and Ethereum. Once August rolled around and the markets took a turn for the worse, you got hit hard and the value of your portfolio dropped significantly. You ended up selling out of all of your positions and took a $7,000 loss. From here, you would be able to harvest a $2,000 loss for the year. This loss would deduct from your taxable income for the year. Let’s say you made $50,000 on the year in income. With this loss, only $48,000 of that income would be taxable.

## Wash sale rules (likely) do not apply to crypto

This is very important for those who want to take advantage of their crypto losses. Like mentioned, a taxable event only occurs when you sell or trade your crypto into another crypto. This means that if you want to take advantage of your losses from 2018, you should sell or trade out of your crypto before Dec. 31st, 2018. By trading into another cryptocurrency, you trigger a taxable event and ""realize"" your losses on paper. You can then file these losses with your tax return. Please consult with a [**qualified tax professional**](https://www.cryptotrader.tax/crypto-tax-accountants) regarding these tactics.

Because [**wash sale rules**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp) do not currently apply to cryptocurrency, you can buy back the crypto you sold to ""harvest"" your losses. This immediate buyback is not allowed in the world of stock trading. This is very helpful for those who want to continue to hold onto their crypto, and this form of tax loss harvesting is a common tactic amongst tax professionals. 

An example - If you bought $2,000 worth of Bitcoin in February of 2018, that investment would now be worth about $600 USD give or take. To take advantage of this loss, you should trade all of that Bitcoin for Ethereum BEFORE Dec 31st and then trade back that same amount. Now you still have your Bitcoin, but you also ""realized"" this $1,400 loss on paper. This loss offsets other gains or income on your tax bill!

**You can trigger a loss on paper by trading into another cryptocurrency, or by selling into FIAT currency. Both are** [**taxable events**](https://www.cryptotrader.tax/blog/when-do-you-owe-taxes-on-your-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency) **and allow you to ""realize"" your loss.**

## IRS Form 8949

To get more detailed on [**how to report this crypto on your taxes**](https://www.cryptotrader.tax/blog/how-to-report-cryptocurrency-on-taxes), you need to report each trade that you made on the [**IRS form 8949**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8949.pdf), Sales and Dispositions of other Capital Assets. For every trade that you made during the year, you list the amount of crypto traded, the price traded at, the date traded, the cost basis for the trade, and the capital gain or loss that occurred. Continue to list every trade from the year on this form and total up the net losses at the bottom.

## What if I made a lot of trades during the year?

A lot of crypto enthusiasts trade quite often. If you haven’t been keeping a record of the dates of your trades, the dollar value amounts that you bought and sold your crypto for, and the capital gains/losses from those trades, this reporting process, and creating your 8949 form can become a huge headache. If this is a scenario that you are faced with (don’t worry we were in the exact same boat), it could be beneficial to leverage cryptocurrency tax software platforms like [**CryptoTrader.Tax**](https://www.cryptotrader.tax/) to automatically create your 8949 for you. All you have to do is import your trades.

Once you have your total capital gains and losses added together on the form 8949, you transfer the total amount onto your [**1040 Schedule D**](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-schedule-d-form-1040-capital-gains-and-losses).

## Wrapping Up

Ideally you are a wizard of a crypto trader, and you won’t have to harvest any losses from your trading activity.
