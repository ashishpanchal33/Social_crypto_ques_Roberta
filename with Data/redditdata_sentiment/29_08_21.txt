Okay fine it’s not been battle tested like ETH and it has yet to prove it can do what it promises. 

That’s what makes it a great buy. If you wait until something is proven there is going to be far less room for growth then if you buy in early before the adoption begins. People bought ETH at $5 prior to the massive ecosystem now. How you think they like that speculation?

It being only speculation means if it comes through on its promises it’s price could ballon. The MC of ETH is sitting at 376B. ADA is 92B. 1/4 of ETH. I’m not saying it will grow to that level. It could release SC and suck and drop to $1. It could in ten years be excellent and adopted by large governments and soar to ETHs price making it about $12. IDK.

Only a few years ago Tesla wasn’t the powerhouse it is now.  Few years before that (2003), Tesla didn’t even exist. Amazon didn’t exist in 1994.  Companies come and they go.  They gain popularity and drop out of the spotlight, etc.

I believe that the future of crypto will be similar.  That’s a generalization because some crypto will go on as value- like Bitcoin.  But even those can the potential to lose popularity or be replaced.  

It’s actually true now.  There are failed projects- there are projects that are taking off, there are projects making changes to compete… There will always be new adventures to be had.  Even now there are projects popping up EVERYWHERE.  There are many blockchains and projects that may or may not last- some of which haven’t yet seen the growth they have the potential for.

Even if Bitcoin is at its hypothetical ath of 100k- there will always be projects coming about, succeeding, failing.. 

So are you late?  Get with it- this tech is here to stay and grow and optimize and grow even further.  You’d be wrong to assume that coins and projects won’t fail, or that other coins that aren’t popular now won’t someday become popular.  Especially true for small cap projects on the blockchains themselves- many of which offer tokens that may one day prove to have been a significant investment.

What coins, projects, or tokens do you believe deserve the top 50 in 5 and 10 years, that nobody knows about yet?


PSA don’t read this and get swept up in some shitcoin you feel might pump. That’s one of those coins that have a higher chance of ending up in that dreaded “coins that failed” category.

So we have a new addition to the family! :-)

I was thinking I would love to give her the gift of being able to start life as an adult, financially in a very good way.  It would be amazing if she could start out with her own home, owned free and clear!  If the only thing she needed to work for was food, utilities and retirement, that would be amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my question.  I do not have a ton to invest, but I want to know what coins you would you recommend as the  best long term, as in I will not touch this for almost 18 years long term, coins to get her?  I am assuming I will see BTC and ETH, but I would love to read what else people recommend as a very long term investment.  I will be investing what I can, throwing them in a wallet and leaving them until her 18th, adding to the balance as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking I will invest in the top few mentioned here and would greatly appreciate your suggestions (especially if you take the time to explain why).

We all want the best staking rate, and would like compounding (i.e. staked rewards on our staked  rewards) to be as frequent as possible. To facilitate compounding, ALGO Optimizer comes in (https://algooptimizer.com/).

Say you hold 100 ALGO, and have 0.5 ALGO available in staking rewards. You are only earning staking rewards on the 100 ALGO, *unless* of course a transaction is made to your wallet, which essentially confirms your new balance (100 + 0.5 = 100.5) on the blockchain, making it so you earn interest via staking rewards on 100.5 ALGO.

ALGO Optimizer is a service that costs 1 ALGO to set up, and will use your public address (not private key, not seed phrase - if you don't know the difference, please move on) to send 0 ALGO transaction to your wallet, resetting the balance (adding your staking rewards to your current balance). 

You can enter your public key into their calculator in order to determine if setting up the optimizer is worth the 1 ALGO or not (for me, it is).

*Note: Keep in mind this is only relevant until ~January 2022 when ALGO's governance reward system goes into effect (afaik)**"|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3382339|public|self|A compounding tool for those who hold ALGO|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pdwqh0/a_compounding_tool_for_those_who_hold_algo/|all_ads|6|1630229199.0|MINING-STAKING|38a8ac5a-9d5c-11e5-a136-0e9f3a832fc3|MINING-STAKING|||||||||||2021-08-29 14:56:39+00:00|t3_pdwqh0|0|13|0.81||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||29_08_21|08_21|0.13876511|0.43744275|0.4237922|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0502968467772007|0.11756440997123718|0.007791576907038689|0.5525232553482056|0.2615329921245575|0.010290921665728092

And I must agree

However, I did the exact opposite and it made me a pretty decent amount of cash.
Anyway. I had about 1100 Dogecoin sitting in my wallet. And my buddy was shit talking Elon and how Doge really hasn't been the same since its fall from grace at 0.70 cents. For whatever reason, I said fuck it and converted all my Dogecoin to Solana that night (I do NOT remember doing that.) Anyway, that was a week ago. I don't quite remember how much Solana was, but I'm assuming it was around $60 ish. I just checked my wallet and saw a substantial increase in it's value which didn't correspond to the figure I had on my online portfolio on Coinmarketcap.

 So I investigated. My Dogecoin was missing, but I found Solana in its place. With each token at the time of writing, being worth $95. Needless to say, I'm quite happy indeed, and have been bullish on solana for a while ahha.

In **Bull** market you can take some profits so you can improve your life or to buy later in bear market or do no thing and watch your investing grow .

In **Bear** market many people start to lose interest in crypto and start to sell in low prices, which is healthy for the market , because once trembling hands go out of market it can pump again easy without any stop . Also in bear market you can buy and DCA in your favorite coins at discount .

In **Crab** market you can’t do anything else watching charts which hardly move , small up to make you believe it’s a bull market then small down to make you believe it’s a bear market . In this market it’s risky to buy and sell because it can change direction anytime

I use it often to see how much a coin could hypothetically be worth, with realistic data. Too often I see people throwing around crazy numbers for the coins they hold. For example, “Doge to $100!” A simple visit to this site and a few clicks later would bring you right down to earth. If Doge reached the market cap of Bitcoin right now it would only be worth $6.96…. It would need a market cap of 13 Trillion to reach $100. 

By comparing different coins by market value I was able to get a good idea of what one of my main holdings, ALGO, could be worth. For example, I was interested to see how much ALGO would be worth if it had the current market cap of ADA. One ALGO would be $26.56 at Cardano’s current market cap!

I am trying to understand the technology, the community and the trends surrounding this mythical beast. I am happy to share with you one of the interesting things I learned during this weekend!

Cryptocurrency is volatile as we all have come to know but did you guys observe that usually the prices plummet during weekends? Yes this is an actual phenomena - and it is known as the Sunday Effect! And as it turns out there is a reasons behind this. Allow me to share few of the things I learned while I was researching today. This is not really an OC as I have included snippets from a news article! 

There are primarily two reasons behind this but there is also a speculation (pt. no. 3) which can also have an effect in this phenomena but best to take the third with a bit of a salt: 

1. **Less trading during weekends**: Banks remain closed over the weekends, and there is often less trading as investors may not be able to add money to their accounts. This, in turn, results in low volume trading, during which the same trade size can move prices a lot more.
2. **Trading on margins**: When prices dip below a certain level, traders trading on margins (i.e., borrowing money from the exchanges to buy more assets) must repay the loan, known as a ""margin call."" But if investors don't cover the loan, exchanges may sell the digital assets to ensure they receive the borrowed money back. With banks closed over the weekend, some traders struggle to pay off the borrowed funds as they can't move money into their accounts, triggering sell-offs from exchanges.
3. **Market manipulation** (it's more of speculation): Many studies indicate that market manipulation influences crypto prices. A case in point is a [2019 research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195066) showing how tether may have artificially inflated bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices during the 2017 boom. But researchers still aren't sure about the extent to which this manipulation happens. One theory pointing to spoofing suggests executing fake buy or sell orders to influence cryptocurrency prices by creating a false sense of supply and demand. Some believe this happens more often during the week, causing digital currency prices to rise. But this theory may well only be speculation as experts have mixed opinions on this.

So I have been FOMOing a lot lately and I tried to buy some NFTs. And it was a horrible experience.

1.  First of all, as prices are in ETH, it's way too easy to overspend (I spent 4x times more than what I intended). 
2. Second of all, due to gas fees, you end up paying twice the price. 
3. You have gas fees to exchange ETH to WETH (that allows to bid) and vice-versa.

But that's not the worse. Even with very high gas fees, I have transactions that are just lost. They don't appear on etherscan, I don't have my NFTs, and I'm just lost in here wondering what happenned to me. 

Anyway, if you have any tips on how to get smarter with NFTs I'll take it. How do you find good projects? I fill like I'm coming way too late all the time

In recognizing cryptocurrency, Cuba may be able to bypass the United States embargo, which prohibits the island’s international commerce and remittances.

After the rise of cryptopunks, we have seen the surge of bored apes yacht club, penguins, even rocks!! And then hundred more projects that are deploying over that platform with thousands of NFTs, with lower prices than a cryptopunk ofc but they still have pieces selling above $200 $300 $500...

So i was following a project called cupcat nft, i thought its nice, not many people following it, so i thought this is good, not too many people will ape at start so i wont have to strugle with failed txs and that, maybe would take several hours till all the nfts are minted so its ok!!. But then, yesterday some big accounts on twitter like Andre Cronje, Cobbie and others started talking about the project and from 1 day to another, thousands flooded the discord and the chat. After that i started thinking, this project has a sad story in it, the person who is drawing the cats its saying it needs to deploy and collect money to improve her life, to help cats also, her bf and more... Then several influencers shilling it. What it came to my mind, and its a thought i dont know if its like this or not, is that its all a play to take money out of users. This has been something done with several projects now, and some people are making a fking fortune of it!! Almost all those new users who enter, im fking sure that the majority are just hoping to mint the NFT at a low price and then after some days sell it more expensive and leave to find another oportunity. In some part reminds me in the ""im in for the tech"" in here would be ""im in for the art"" but in reality 99.9% are in for the money, i dont think thats bad dont get me wrong. But what i think its bad its the influencers going out for your money.

And after that i also thought, ok this is something i have been seeing the last couples of week too, NFT projects that are already on OpenSea, that no one is buying them because they are normal and probably not worth spending $500 on them. One day to another, a couple of influencers post about them, boom!! They become popular, floor price $500 and the cycle starts."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3382926|public|self|NFT makers and influencers are out for your money|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pe0kql/nft_makers_and_influencers_are_out_for_your_money/|all_ads|6|1630241347.0|FOCUSED-DISCUSSION||FOCUSED-DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-08-29 18:19:07+00:00|t3_pe0kql|0|5|0.78||0||[]|False|True|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||29_08_21|08_21|0.11630854|0.45205623|0.4316354|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07758814096450806|0.24844463169574738|0.020637458190321922|0.3100588023662567|0.3177177309989929|0.02555321902036667

This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion since a lot of you are benefiting from the moon system but as somebody who's been active in this sub for years it's *very* obvious the negative impact moons have had on this sub over time. 

The idea of the MOON system was to incentivize *quality* content by rewarding people who made popular posts/comments. In theory this system makes sense, especially combined with the governance aspects, and I think it was a worthwhile experiment. However, this is obviously not what's happening in practice. You have people spamming 100s of short and largely useless comments 24/7 which are not even original and just something they saw get upvotes before or whatever. These are people who would've never ventured to comment before the moon system was in place because they don't really have anything to say. ""Karma whoring"" has always been a sitewide issue but adding monetary incentive for it makes it 100x worse (shocking lol). 

If you added this to every sub on the site you would annihilate every top community. IMHO the moons experiment has failed miserably. Its *decreased* content quality and basically ran off anybody who was making quality contribution regularly. Any genuine posters left are buried in spam comments/posts trying to farm moons."|False|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3382681|public|self|I think if moons were pushed sitewide it would literally kill reddit.|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pdyz4d/i_think_if_moons_were_pushed_sitewide_it_would/|all_ads|6|1630236345.0|MOONS|f8383538-5cd9-11e8-b037-0e5fb51a12ae||||||||||||2021-08-29 16:55:45+00:00|t3_pdyz4d|0|234|0.88||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||29_08_21|08_21|0.11373047|0.41845116|0.46781844|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.04209398850798607|0.06655336916446686|0.0036040658596903086|0.8177513480186462|0.06688778847455978|0.0031094748992472887

He was a politician running in New York and his main argument was that the rent was too damn high. 

#I wanted to do the same but with Ethereum Gas Fees. Why? Because they are too damn high!

I represent the **Gas Fees Are Too Damn High Party.** People are farming 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week, Some a third job.

Crypto enthusiasts can’t afford to take care of their family, feed their children breakfast lunch and dinner.  

My main job is to provide inexpensive gas fees, a trezor on your table, and crypto in your pocket. This is politics as usual. Playing the shilling game isn’t going to happen.

The gas fees are too damn high. People that I am here to represent can't afford to pay their gas fees. 

They are paying 50% in gas fees as I speak. They can't eat breakfast lunch and dinner... 

Listen, someones wallet just growled...did you hear it?! You gotta listen like me! Lets talk about the issue! 

People can't afford their gas fees. The gas fees are too damn high! 

As a karate expert, I will not talk bad about any coins. Because our children cannot afford to live anywhere. Nowhere. Theres nowhere to go. 

Once again why? You said it, the gas fees are too damn high! 

If you want to marry a coin, I will marry you.

How the media constantly spreads FUD about crypto?  Inflation is supposed to be ""2-3%"" a year but arguably could be as high as 7% or more a year.  The purchasing power of the dollar keeps decreasing every year.  The cost of goods rises faster than wages.  Banks only give you 1-2% interest on savings accounts if that, and some banks in the world even have negative interest rates.  You're losing money just by having it in a bank account.  With all that being said, the system was designed to keep the general population uneducated and poor.

Cryptocurrency, we're still under 10% for mass adoption in the world.  For many of us, this is our way out and our means for financial freedom. 


The following is an excerpt from George Carlin's
Life Is Worth Losing.  Performed on November 5th, 2005 at the Beacon Theater in New York City, New York.


""But there’s a reason. There’s a reason. There’s a reason for this, there’s a reason education SUCKS, and it’s the same reason it will never, ever, EVER be fixed.  It’s never going to get any better, don’t look for it, be happy with what you’ve got.

Because the owners, the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the BIG owners! The Wealthy… the REAL owners! The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.

Forget the politicians. They are irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice! You have OWNERS! They OWN YOU. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.

They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want.  Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don’t want: 

They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. That's against their interests.

That's right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that!

You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this fucking place! It's a big club, and you ain’t in it!  You, and I, are not in the big club.

By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table has tilted folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care! Good honest hard-working people; white collar, blue collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-working people continue, these are people of modest means, continue to elect these rich cock suckers who don’t give a fuck about you….they don’t give a fuck about you… they don’t give a FUCK about you.

They don’t care about you at all… at all… AT ALL.  And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. That's what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick thats being jammed up their assholes everyday, because the owners of this country know the truth.

It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.""

No, not really. That's like saying the money in your bank isn't your money, and that you should cold storage in your own safe to ensure its security. 

It seems to me after doing some research, that far more people and far more money is lost in transferring coin to cold storages and losing access than it is being left on exchanges. 

Most reputable exchanges are insured in the event that it's hacked and money is displaced. I can understand people wanting to protect their investments, but to the extent of managing a cold wallet seems incredibly counter-intuitive considering the aforementioned facts.

It was a newer store that was prob only a few years old. I usually go through the self check out registers in stores but they didn't have any, so I headed towards a cashier. 

The lady in front of me is checking out and it's taking a while. She's older probably nearly in her 60s. She pulls out a check and uses it the pay for her groceries. Fine no big deal. The cashier has to run the check through a scanner of some sort and checks the ladies id. The whole process takes over a minute, so I patiently waited until I could check out. 

It got me thinking. Back in the day paying with a check was considered normal. I can't remember the last check I wrote, maybe the dmv 5 years ago? I'm in my 30s and pay for most physical items in store with my card and sometimes mobile pay. There was a time when society was only Cash and checks. Imagine a society that adopts crypto right along side mobile payments.

We can literally pay for things with our phones or a plastic credit card. These things are considered normal. Imagine when adoption starts to take off. Checks have nearly become a thing of the past. I think we have quite a ways to go. We're still really early in this whole crypto game. 

What do you think could be a game changer to really get crypto adoption accelerated? Do you think regulations could positive encourage adoption? I think crypto has only scratched the surface of its potential."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3380781|public|self|Crypto adoption distant but inevitable?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pdoxf5/crypto_adoption_distant_but_inevitable/|all_ads|6|1630192529.0|SPECULATION|3d5fe240-70f9-11e8-95ba-0e0d9c4aac4a|SPECULATION|||||||||||2021-08-29 04:45:29+00:00|t3_pdoxf5|0|6|0.69||1||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||29_08_21|08_21|0.11076456|0.4499968|0.43923864|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07071885466575623|0.20293867588043213|0.01466779038310051|0.2337827980518341|0.4597536027431488|0.018138350918889046

Anyway where would you park half a bitcoin for seventeen years for a mix of safety and appreication.  


Logically I know HODLing is the safest bet, and considering the return he has made already there is a strong argument to be made just to leave that BTC sat on it's hardware wallet.

Hi Everybody,

I´m one of those fools that just lost a lot of crypto sending on the wrong network. Is it lost for good, or is there anything I can do to retrieve it?

I sent A LOT of Shiba Inu from my Binance account to Bitmart. However, I used the BNB network (because of lower fees) instead of the ERC20. I completely overlooked, that I couldn´t use the BNB network. Obviously the withdrawal never made it to Bitmart.

I´ve managed to find the info about the trade on BscScan. The withdrawal is hanging out there in cyber space without any direction. I don´t know what to do from here. For the info I don´t have a hard wallet if that makes any difference.

If anybody knows what to do, please help a crypto amateur..."|True|False|False|CryptoCurrency|t5_2wlj3|3382988|public|self|Sent crypto on the wrong network.

Compare the YTD chart with the one for Bitcoin. SWTH is about the same price, while BTC is up by more than 50% !

I have to thank it did not drop to zero, but still i am missing out.

Just want to ask anyone what is the reason for this poor performance, and whether it will likely skyrocket in the upcoming altseason (if it will ever begin ).

And with skyrocketing i mean, preferably outperforming the Bitcoin price. Otherwise i may well swap it for BTC."|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|587994|public|self|Switcheo SWTH price analysis?|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/pdxdxj/switcheo_swth_price_analysis/|all_ads|6|1630231294.0|technicals|145e6030-8ad8-11e3-9de0-12313b0c91be|TECHNICALS|||||||||||2021-08-29 15:31:34+00:00|t3_pdxdxj|0|2|0.75||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||29_08_21|08_21|0.12710072|0.5120065|0.36089268|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.07240058481693268|0.2270035296678543|0.01829255372285843|0.4567823112010956|0.21297985315322876|0.012541070580482483

It will be a bloodbath, anyone holding Ripple should get out whilst they can.

$53bn valuation is composed of tremendous hype, true valuation is nearer $200m based on legacy bank deals who won't use ripple long term with much better solutions out there. CBDCs - central bank digital coins, controlled by central banks themselves, very doubtful they will choose XRP.

At least there should be an option to have wait periods to validate withdrawals.|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/pe3nmd/why_is_there_no_security_against_being_robbed/|all_ads|6|1630251041.0|discussion|d990f59a-aa4d-11e3-bb1c-12313d053130|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-08-29 21:00:41+00:00|t3_pe3nmd|0|3|1.0||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||29_08_21|08_21|0.09943512|0.50272423|0.39784065|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0823168158531189|0.11424129456281662|0.01224549487233162|0.49923110008239746|0.2819773554801941|0.009987949393689632

Crypto confuses the average person, but with ACH that gets solved. The user can invest in crypto of choice, (40 different coins to choose from) then use that crypto for their ACH Visa or Mastercard and spend their money as fiat or crypto in real world time. No waiting for transfers! Isn't that the ultimate goal to be able to use Crypto as a currency??? Instead of putting money in a bank you can invest it all, all the time! This can also be linked to Google Pay and Apple Pay. They are also handling the transactions between Binance and Shopify! They are currently in Beta testing and will be released later this year. I fully expect a 10-30x happening from this point this year. Alchemy Pay is gonna be huge. $.11 area at the moment, could easily 10-30x by Christmas. If you didn't get in on the first massive wave don't think it's to late make a killing. ACH has 3.2 billion in circulation. Capped at 10 billion. Matic has 6.2 billion in circulation and capped at 10 billion. ACH has half the amount of coins in circulation that Matic does and they are released over a 5 year time from. Early February of this year Matic was $.06 a coin. It went from that to $2.68 in May. Matic went from $.80 to $2.68 in 11 days in May. ACH will be involved in far more transactions daily than Matic and its not even close. It is an amazing utility coin with very strategic partners. They have a massive new partner that will be announced shortly. Conglomerate from the middle east. It is bigger than and partner they have yet and they have Shopify and Binance plus a ton of others. This coin could easily 10-30x this year. Possibly more depending on who they bring in. Isn't crypto a currency? Now it can be treated like one. That is a major part of mass adoption. With ACH it is now possible and you can chose over types of crypto to spend. You can spend it as crypto or convert it to fiat based upon what the vendor wants. With a low market cap and just a matter of time until it skyrockets.|True|False|False|CryptoMarkets|t5_2z2wm|588093|public|self|Alchemy Pay ACH|https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/pe20sy/alchemy_pay_ach/|all_ads|6|1630245876.0|discussion|d990f59a-aa4d-11e3-bb1c-12313d053130|DISCUSSION|||||||||||2021-08-29 19:34:36+00:00|t3_pe20sy|0|16|0.79||0||[]|False|False|[]||||[]||False|False|||||||||||||||29_08_21|08_21|0.13876511|0.43744275|0.4237922|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0502968467772007|0.11756440997123718|0.007791576907038689|0.5525232553482056|0.2615329921245575|0.010290921665728092
